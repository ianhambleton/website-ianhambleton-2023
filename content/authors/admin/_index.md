**PhD-level statistician / data scientist.** I have worked as a statistician for 25 years in Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean. I organise project data handling and analytics, including the management of solutions for robust and secure online data collection. I have published around 200 peer-reviewed articles covering a range of chronic and infectious diseases. Working with colleagues, I have secured around 14 million US dollars of funding for health-related research. I am committed to open-access data, and am developing an infrastructure for collecting and sharing Caribbean research data. I work with a range of Caribbean and international agencies involved in health and wellness.
