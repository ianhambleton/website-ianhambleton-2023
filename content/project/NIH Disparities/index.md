### The US-Caribbean Health Disparities Research Collaboration
#### Secondary analyses of regional health inequalities using publically available data. 
The US National Institute on Minority health and Health Disparities funded a 5-year program (2011 to 2016) to explore and compare for the first time health disparities among African-descent populations in the Caribbean and the US. The work used published articles, Caribbean health databases, and open-access data to build an evidence-based picture of Caribbean health disparities.

Our analytical outputs can be grouped into three types: systematic reviews, Caribbean-wide analyses, and country-specific analyses.

**Systematic reviews**
An important component of the work was the production of systematic reviews to summarize the available information on a range of health concerns. Published systematic review articles are as follows:

**Caribbean secondary analyses**
Secondary analyses were performed to provide Caribbean-level health-inequality outputs, using either Latin Ameerica or the united States as comparator groups:

**Country-level secondary analyses**
Country level information, when available and accessible, was used provide in-country analyses of health inequalities.
