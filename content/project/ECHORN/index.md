### The Eastern Caribbean Health Outcomes Research Network
#### A Research Collaboration Focused On Chronic Disease In The Eastern Caribbean
[The Eastern Caribbean Health Outcomes Research Network](http://echorn.org/) (ECHORN) is a collaborative research study that examines the lifestyles, eating habits, and health behaviors associated with cancer, diabetes and heart disease in adult men and women living in the Eastern Caribbean. Funded by the National Institute for Minority Health Disparities (NIMHD), ECHORN presents a unique opportunity to identify risk and protective factors for chronic disease in a diverse population over time.

I wear a couple of hats in this research infrastructure. I am Chair of the Data Sharing Working Group, and we explore how to best disseminate the ECHORN research information and data resources across the collaboration. I also lead analytics work by our team of data scientists at the [George Alleyne Chronic Disease Research Centre](https://uwi.edu/cdrc/){target="_blank"}.
