abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: There is little information on adverse anaesthetic outcomes
  from the Caribbean. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of anaesthetic
  morbidity and mortality at the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI) and
  to identify possible risk factors. METHODS: All anaesthetic procedures at the UHWI
  were monitored for adverse events and patient outcomes for the 12-month period from
  March 2004 to February 2005. Possible risk factors for these adverse events were
  assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 3185 anaesthetic procedures, the
  incidence of intra-operative events was 201 per 1000 (95% CI 187, 215); 151 per
  1000 being cardiovascular and 26 per 1000 respiratory. Others included excess blood
  loss and equipment failure, hyperglycaemia, nausea and vomiting. Patients with intraoperative
  complications were three times more likely to have complications during recovery
  (OR = 3.35; 95% CI 2.59, 4.33, p < 0.001). The incidence of complications among
  paediatric patients was 139 per 1000 (95% CI 104, 174) intra-operatively and 58
  per 1000 (95% CI 34, 81) during recovery. Risk factors for developing complications
  (p < 0.05) included age > 50 years, ASA status > or = II, prolonged anaesthesia,
  high surgical risk, general or combined anaesthetic techniques, senior anaesthetist,
  intubated patients and co-morbidities. There were 14 operative mortalities, none
  of which was anaesthesia-related CONCLUSION: Anaesthetic complication rates at the
  UHWI are comparable to those in developed countries, except for higher paediatric
  complication rates and ICU admissions and lower rates of postoperative nausea and
  vomiting.'
