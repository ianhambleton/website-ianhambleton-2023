abstract: Being taller is associated with enhanced longevity, and higher education
  and earnings. We reanalysed 1472 population-based studies, with measurement of height
  on more than 18.6 million participants to estimate mean height for people born between
  1896 and 1996 in 200 countries. The largest gain in adult height over the past century
  has occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm (95% credible
  interval 17.5-22.7) and 16.5 cm (13.3-19.7) taller, respectively. In contrast, there
  was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and in South
  Asia over the century of analysis. The tallest people over these 100 years are men
  born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of 20th century, whose average heights
  surpassed 182.5 cm, and the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896 (140.3
  cm; 135.8-144.8). The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations
  was 19-20 cm a century ago, and has remained the same for women and increased for
  men a century later despite substantial changes in the ranking of countries.
