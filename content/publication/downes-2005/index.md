abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence, prevalence, and natural history of
  proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSR). DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal study
  over 20 years. PARTICIPANTS: Newborn screening of 100000 consecutive deliveries
  from 1973 to 1981 identified 315 children with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease
  and 201 with SS-hemoglobin C (SC) disease. By the age of 5 years, 307 SS patients
  and 166 SC patients were alive and living in Jamaica and were recruited for this
  ophthalmic study. METHODS: Description of retinal vascular changes on annual angiography
  and angioscopy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and prevalence of PSR and its behavior
  on follow-up. Progression of PSR was investigated using the number of eyes affected
  (none, one, both) and the interval until PSR onset. RESULTS: At last review in January
  2000, PSR had developed in 59 patients (14 SS, 45 SC), unilaterally in 36 patients
  and bilaterally in 23. Incidence increased with age in both genotypes, with crude
  annual incidence rates of 0.5 cases (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3-0.8) per
  100 SS subjects and 2.5 cases (95% CI, 1.9-3.3) per 100 SC subjects. Prevalence
  was greater in SC disease, and by the ages of 24 to 26 years, PSR had occurred in
  43% subjects with SC disease and in 14% subjects with SS disease. Patients with
  unilateral PSR had a 16% (11% SS, 17% SC) probability of regressing to no PSR and
  a 14% (16% SS, 13% SC) probability of progressing to bilateral PSR. Those with bilateral
  PSR had an 8% (8% SS, 8% SC) probability of regressing to unilateral PSR and a 1%
  (0 SS, 2% SC) probability of regressing to a PSR-free state. Irretrievable visual
  loss occurred in only 1 of 82 PSR-affected eyes, and 1 required detachment surgery
  and recovered normal visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal observations over
  20 years in a cohort of patients followed from birth confirms a greater incidence
  and severity of PSR in SC disease, and shows that spontaneous regression occurred
  in 32% of PSR-affected eyes. Permanent visual loss was uncommon in subjects observed
  up to the age of 26 years.'
