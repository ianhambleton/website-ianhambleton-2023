abstract: There has been an increasing trend worldwide to use regional anaesthesia
  for operative deliveries. The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths in the United
  Kingdom has demonstrated a steady decline in the anaesthesia-related deaths since
  the introduction of regional anaesthesia. There are lower morbidity profiles in
  mothers delivering under regional anaesthesia as well as better infant Apgar scores.
  In 1997, a decision was taken to have at least 60% of all elective Caesarean sections
  done at the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI) performed under spinal
  anaesthesia. This is a review of the anaesthetic technique for Caesarean sections
  at the UHWI since 1996. The Deliveries and Anaesthetic Books on the labour ward
  were reviewed and the type of anaesthesia for elective and emergency Caesarean sections
  recorded for the period January 1996 to December 2001. At the beginning of the period
  under study, more than 90% of the Caesarean sections were being done under general
  anaesthesia. By the middle of 1998, spinal anaesthesia was more commonly employed
  than general anaesthesia for Caesarean sections and by December 2001, more than
  eight out of every ten Caesarean sections were being done under spinal anaesthesia.
  The main reasons for the successful change of practice were that it was consultant-led,
  there was good communication between relevant departments, the junior staff were
  properly trained, there was a consistent supply of appropriate drugs and there was
  a high level of patient satisfaction.
