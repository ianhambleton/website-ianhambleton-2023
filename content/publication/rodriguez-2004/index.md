abstract: 'BACKGROUND: In the face of the continuing pandemic of HIV/AIDS, the burden
  of the disease is now largest in the resource-poor developing world. The Joint United
  Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has listed the adult prevalence rate for
  the Caribbean as second only to Sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: To document the socio-demographic
  characteristics of paediatric and perinatal HIV/AIDS in Kingston, Jamaica. METHODS:
  A cohort of HIV-infected pregnant women were identified at the leading maternity
  centres in Kingston and St Catherine and were enrolled in the Kingston Paediatric
  and Perinatal HIV/AIDS Programme. Infants born to mothers within the programme were
  prospectively enrolled. Infants and children identified after delivery, whether
  HIV-exposed or infected, were also enrolled (retrospective group). All were followed
  according to standardized protocols. RESULTS: We report on a total of 239 children,
  78 (prospective group) and 161 (retrospective group). Among the retrospective group,
  68% were classified as infected. For the prospective group, the patients were recruited
  within twenty-four hours of birth in 98.7% of cases, whereas in the retrospective
  group, the median age of recruitment was 2.6 years. The median age of the mother
  was 27 years and that of the father was 33 years. There were seven teenage mothers.
  Twenty-six per cent of the children were in institutional care. Family size ranged
  from one to nine children--the median was two children. For those parents where
  occupation was reported, the majority held semi-skilled or unskilled jobs. Patients
  attended their regional clinics. CONCLUSION: HIV/AIDS represents a significant human
  and financial burden on a developing country such as Jamaica and this underscores
  the need for urgent and sustained interventions to stem the epidemic.'
