abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The active ingredients of marijuana may have beneficial properties
  in the treatment of chronic pain and inflammation and is being used by sufferers
  of chronic pain and arthritis in some settings. Anecdotally, marijuana is believed
  by some sickle cell disease (SCD) patients to improve their health. This study aimed
  to determine the prevalence of marijuana smoking in the Jamaica Sickle Cell Cohort
  Study (JSCCS) in the years 2000 and 2004. The perception that marijuana use ameliorated
  the complications of SCD was also investigated. METHODS: All patients in the JSCCS
  were invited to attend an annual review, and during the 2000 and 2004 reviews, participants
  with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease and sickle cell haemoglobin-C (SC) disease
  were asked whether they smoked marijuana, and if they smoked, whether it was used
  for medicinal purposes related to SCD. The authors compared smoking prevalence by
  gender, disease, and year of review. The association of smoking with a measure of
  pain frequency was also examined. RESULTS: The prevalence of marijuana smoking was
  higher among men and among SC participants. The proportion of either gender reporting
  smoking of marijuana increased in 2004 compared to 2000, and this use was not related
  to a simple measure of clinical severity of SCD. CONCLUSIONS: Marijuana smoking
  is common in adults with SCD but its usage is unrelated to clinical severity of
  the disease.'
