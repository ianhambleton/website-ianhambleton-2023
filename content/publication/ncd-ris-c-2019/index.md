abstract: Body-mass index (BMI) has increased steadily in most countries in parallel
  with a rise in the proportion of the population who live in cities(1,2). This has
  led to a widely reported view that urbanization is one of the most important drivers
  of the global rise in obesity(3-6). Here we use 2,009 population-based studies,
  with measurements of height and weight in more than 112 million adults, to report
  national, regional and global trends in mean BMI segregated by place of residence
  (a rural or urban area) from 1985 to 2017. We show that, contrary to the dominant
  paradigm, more than 55% of the global rise in mean BMI from 1985 to 2017-and more
  than 80% in some low- and middle-income regions-was due to increases in BMI in rural
  areas. This large contribution stems from the fact that, with the exception of women
  in sub-Saharan Africa, BMI is increasing at the same rate or faster in rural areas
  than in cities in low- and middle-income regions. These trends have in turn resulted
  in a closing-and in some countries reversal-of the gap in BMI between urban and
  rural areas in low- and middle-income countries, especially for women. In high-income
  and industrialized countries, we noted a persistently higher rural BMI, especially
  for women. There is an urgent need for an integrated approach to rural nutrition
  that enhances financial and physical access to healthy foods, to avoid replacing
  the rural undernutrition disadvantage in poor countries with a more general malnutrition
  disadvantage that entails excessive consumption of low-quality calories.
