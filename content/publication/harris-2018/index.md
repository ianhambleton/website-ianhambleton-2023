abstract: 'BACKGROUND: High sodium diets with inadequate potassium and high sodium-to-potassium
  ratios are a known determinant of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
  The Caribbean island of Barbados has a high prevalence of hypertension and mortality
  from CVD. Our objectives were to estimate sodium and potassium excretion, to compare
  estimated levels with recommended intakes and to identify the main food sources
  of sodium in Barbadian adults. METHODS: A sub-sample (n = 364; 25-64 years) was
  randomly selected from the representative population-based Health of the Nation
  cross-sectional study (n = 1234), in 2012-13. A single 24-h urine sample was collected
  from each participant, following a strictly applied protocol designed to reject
  incomplete samples, for the measurement of sodium and potassium excretion (in mg),
  which were used as proxy estimates of dietary intake. In addition, sensitivity analyses
  based on estimated completeness of urine collection from urine creatinine values
  were undertaken. Multiple linear regression was used to examine differences in sodium
  and potassium excretion, and the sodium-to-potassium ratio, by age, sex and educational
  level. Two 24-h recalls were used to identify the main dietary sources of sodium.
  All analyses were weighted for the survey design. RESULTS: Mean sodium excretion
  was 2656 (2488-2824) mg/day, with 67% (62-73%) exceeding the World Health Organization
  (WHO) recommended limit of 2000 mg/d. Mean potassium excretion was 1469 (1395-1542)
  mg/d; < 0.5% met recommended minimum intake levels. Mean sodium-to-potassium ratio
  was 2.0 (1.9-2.1); not one participant had a ratio that met WHO recommendations.
  Higher potassium intake and lower sodium-to-potassium ratio were independently associated
  with age and tertiary education. Sensitivity analyses based on urine creatinine
  values did not notably alter these findings. CONCLUSIONS: In this first nationally
  representative study with objective assessment of sodium and potassium excretion
  in a Caribbean population in over 20 years, levels of sodium intake were high, and
  potassium intake was low. Younger age and lower educational level were associated
  with the highest sodium-to-potassium ratios. These findings provide baseline values
  for planning future policy interventions for non-communicable disease prevention.'
