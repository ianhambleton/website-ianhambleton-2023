abstract: "BACKGROUND: Current understanding of population physical activity (PA)\
  \ levels and sedentary behaviour in developing countries is limited, and based primarily\
  \ on self-report. We described PA levels using objective and self-report methods\
  \ in a developing country population. METHODS: PA was assessed in a cross-sectional,\
  \ representative sample of the population of Barbados (25-54 years), using a validated\
  \ questionnaire (RPAQ) and individually calibrated combined heart rate and movement\
  \ sensing monitors. The RPAQ collects information on recalled activity in 4 domains:\
  \ home, work, transport, and leisure. Physical inactivity was defined according\
  \ to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines; sedentary lifestyle was defined\
  \ as being sedentary for 8 h or more daily; PA overestimation was defined as perceiving\
  \ activity to be sufficient, when classified as 'inactive' by objective measurement.\
  \ RESULTS: According to objective estimates, 90.5 % (95 % CI: 83.3,94.7) of women\
  \ and 58.9 % (48.4,68.7) of men did not accumulate sufficient activity to meet WHO\
  \ minimum recommendations. Overall, 50.7 % (43.3,58.1) of the population was sedentary\
  \ for 8 h or more each day, and 60.1 % (52.8,66.9) overestimated their activity\
  \ levels. The prevalence of inactivity was underestimated by self-report in both\
  \ genders by 28 percentage points (95 % CI: 18,38), but the accuracy of reporting\
  \ differed by age group, education level, occupational grade, and overweight/obesity\
  \ status. Low PA was greater in more socially privileged groups: higher educational\
  \ level and higher occupational grade were both associated with less objectively\
  \ measured PA and more sedentary time. Variation in domain-specific self-reported\
  \ physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) by educational attainment was observed:\
  \ higher education level was associated with more leisure activity and less occupational\
  \ activity. Occupational PA was the main driver of PAEE for women and men according\
  \ to self-report, contributing 57 % (95 % CI: 52,61). The most popular leisure activities\
  \ for both genders were walking and gardening. CONCLUSIONS: The use of both objective\
  \ and self-report methods to assess PA and sedentary behaviour provides important\
  \ complementary information to guide public health programmes. Our results emphasize\
  \ the urgent need to increase PA and reduce sedentary time in this developing country\
  \ population. Women and those with higher social economic position are particularly\
  \ at risk from low levels of physical activity."
