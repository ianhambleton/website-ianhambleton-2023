abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization has advocated for sugar-sweetened
  beverage (SSB) taxes as part of a broader non-communicable disease prevention strategy,
  and these taxes have been recently introduced in a wide range of settings. However,
  much is still unknown about how SSB taxes operate in various contexts and as a result
  of different tax designs. In 2015, the Government of Barbados implemented a 10%
  ad valorem (value-based) tax on SSBs. It has been hypothesized that this tax structure
  may inadvertently encourage consumers to switch to cheaper sugary drinks. We aimed
  to assess whether and to what extent there has been a change in sales of SSBs following
  implementation of the SSB tax. METHODS: We used electronic point of sale data from
  a major grocery store chain and applied an interrupted time series (ITS) design
  to assess grocery store SSB and non-SSB sales from January 2013 to October 2016.
  We controlled for the underlying time trend, seasonality, inflation, tourism and
  holidays. We conducted sensitivity analyses using a cross-country control (Trinidad
  and Tobago) and a within-country control (vinegar). We included a post-hoc stratification
  by price tertile to assess the extent to which consumers may switch to cheaper sugary
  drinks. RESULTS: We found that average weekly sales of SSBs decreased by 4.3% (95%CI
  3.6 to 4.9%) compared to expected sales without a tax, primarily driven by a decrease
  in carbonated SSBs sales of 3.6% (95%CI 2.9 to 4.4%). Sales of non-SSBs increased
  by 5.2% (95%CI 4.5 to 5.9%), with bottled water sales increasing by an average of
  7.5% (95%CI 6.5 to 8.3%). The sensitivity analyses were consistent with the uncontrolled
  results. After stratifying by price, we found evidence of substitution to cheaper
  SSBs. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the Barbados SSB tax was associated
  with decreased sales of SSBs in a major grocery store chain after controlling for
  underlying trends. This finding was robust to sensitivity analyses. We found evidence
  to suggest that consumers may have changed their behaviour in response to the tax
  by purchasing cheaper sugary drinks, in addition to substituting to untaxed products.
  This has important implications for the design of future SSB taxes.'
