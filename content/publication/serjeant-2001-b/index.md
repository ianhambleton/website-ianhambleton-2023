abstract: 'AIMS: (1) To investigate the distribution of age at menarche in a representative
  sample of 99 patients with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease, 69 with sickle cell
  haemoglobin C (SC) disease, and 100 controls with a normal haemoglobin (AA) genotype
  followed in a cohort study from birth. (2) To explore the determinants of the age
  at menarche. METHODS: Children ascertained in a newborn screening programme were
  followed prospectively from birth to age 18-26.5 years with regular assessments
  of height, weight, pubertal stage, and haematological indices at the Sickle Cell
  Clinic of the University Hospital of the West Indies. RESULTS: All subjects have
  now reached menarche and the mean age in normal controls (13.0 years) was significantly
  earlier than in SC disease (13.5 years) or SS disease (15.4 years). Greater weight
  and earlier age at menarche was the only association significant across all genotypes
  although additional contributions occurred from fetal haemoglobin and red cell count
  in SS disease. Alpha thalassaemia, which ameliorates many of the effects of SS disease,
  had no discernible effect on menarche. CONCLUSIONS: Mean age at menarche is delayed
  by 0.5 years in SC disease and by 2.4 years in SS disease. Weight appears to be
  the principle determinant of age at menarche.'
