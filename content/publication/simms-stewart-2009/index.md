abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To document an increased prevalence of retained placenta in
  mothers with homozygous sickle cell disease. METHODS: A retrospective review (January
  1, 1992, to December 31, 2005) at the University Hospital of the West Indies revealed
  174 singleton deliveries in women with sickle cell disease who were matched by delivery
  date and age 1:1 with 174 mothers with normal hemoglobin phenotype. Cesarean delivery
  in 62 mothers (36%) with sickle cell and in 41 women with normal hemoglobin (24%)
  left 112 sickle cell and 133 normal hemoglobin pregnancies with spontaneous deliveries.
  Retained placenta was defined by an interval of at least 30 minutes. Duration and
  details of the third stage of delivery were obtained by review of records. Duration
  of delivery stages was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival charts and tested using
  the log rank test. Known risk factors were sought by logistic regression or exact
  logistic regression when the number of outcomes was small. RESULTS: First-stage
  duration was similar in maternal genotypes (sickle cell 470 minutes [median] compared
  with normal hemoglobin 335 minutes [median]), but in sickle cell disease, the second
  stage was slightly delayed (sickle cell 16 minutes compared with normal hemoglobin
  15 minutes) and the third stage (sickle cell 7 minutes compared with normal hemoglobin
  6 minutes). Retained placenta occurred in 20 mothers (17.9%) with sickle cell (interval
  30-340 minutes) compared with four among the women in the control group (3.0%, 30-107
  minutes). Apart from a weak association with combined oxytocin and misoprostol,
  there were no significant associations with known risk factors or with hematologic
  indices within sickle cell disease. CONCLUSION: Retained placenta is common among
  mothers with sickle cell disease, and the lack of association with known risk factors
  suggests that maternal sickle cell disease may be a risk factor. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:
