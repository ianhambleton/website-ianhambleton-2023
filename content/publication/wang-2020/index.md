abstract: Precision medicine seeks to leverage technology to improve the health for
  all individuals. Successful health information systems rely fundamentally on the
  integration and sharing of data from a range of disparate sources. In many settings,
  basic infrastructure inequities exist that limit the usefulness of health information
  systems. We discuss the work of the Yale Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center
  for Health Disparities focused on Precision Medicine, which aims to improve the
  health of people in the Caribbean and Caribbean diaspora by leveraging precision
  medicine approaches. We describe a participatory informatics approach to sharing
  data as a potential mechanism to reducing inequities in the existing data infrastructure.
