 abstract = {Precision medicine seeks to leverage technology to improve the health for all individuals. Successful health information systems rely fundamentally on the integration and sharing of data from a range of disparate sources. In many settings, basic infrastructure inequities exist that limit the usefulness of health information systems. We discuss the work of the Yale Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center for Health Disparities focused on Precision Medicine, which aims to improve the health of people in the Caribbean and Caribbean diaspora by leveraging precision medicine approaches. We describe a participatory informatics approach to sharing data as a potential mechanism to reducing inequities in the existing data infrastructure.},
