abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To assess the epidemiology, clinical features, and outcomes\
  \ of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the predominantly African Caribbean population\
  \ of Barbados. METHODS: A national registry of all patients diagnosed with SLE was\
  \ established in 2007. Complete case ascertainment was facilitated by collaboration\
  \ with the island's sole rheumatology service, medical practitioners, and the lupus\
  \ advocacy group. Informed consent was required for inclusion. RESULTS: Between\
  \ January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2009, there were 183 new cases of SLE (98% African\
  \ Caribbean) affecting 172 women and 11 men for unadjusted annual incidence rates\
  \ of 12.21 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 10.46-14.18) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.42-1.51)\
  \ per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Excluding pediatric cases (ages <18 years),\
  \ the unadjusted incidence rate among women was 15.14 per 100,000 person-years.\
  \ The principal presenting manifestations were arthritis (84%), nephritis (47%),\
  \ pleuritis (41.5%), malar rash (36.4%), and discoid lesions (33.1%). Antinuclear\
  \ antibody positivity was 95%. The overall 5-year survival rate was 79.9% (95% CI\
  \ 69.6-87.1), decreasing to 68% in patients with nephritis. A total of 226 persons\
  \ with SLE were alive at the end of the study for point prevalences of 152.6 (95%\
  \ CI 132.8-174.5) and 10.1 (95% CI 5.4-17.2) per 100,000 among women and men, respectively.\
  \ CONCLUSION: Rates of SLE in Barbadian women are among the highest reported to\
  \ date, with clinical manifestations similar to African American women and high\
  \ mortality. Further study of this population and similar populations of West African\
  \ descent might assist our understanding of environmental, genetic, and health care\
  \ issues underpinning disparities in SLE."
