abstract: "AIM: The study tested the hypothesis that doctors using an insulin information\
  \ checklist during simulated insulin initiation would impart more information regarding\
  \ insulin use. METHODS: A total of 128 simulations were conducted. Doctors (n =\
  \ 64) were recruited from practitioners recently completing internship (n = 19)\
  \ and those established in primary care (n = 45). Both groups of doctors were strata\
  \ randomized to control (n = 32) and intervention groups (n = 32), so that each\
  \ group contained equal numbers. Doctors in each group experienced two identical\
  \ simulations of insulin initiation with an intervening period of 10 min. Doctors\
  \ in the intervention arm were introduced to an insulin initiation checklist, which\
  \ they reviewed independently and utilized in the second simulation. Trained assessors\
  \ captured the provision of education in 21 predefined educational areas. Differences\
  \ in the change of the total education provided between the first and second simulations\
  \ were assessed using linear regression. RESULTS: The difference in the mean change\
  \ of education provided between the first and second simulations within the 21 educational\
  \ areas for the control and treatment groups was 9.7 [95% confidence interval (CI):\
  \ 8.8-11.1, P < 0.001] - an increase of 46.2%. The difference for the 15 areas relevant\
  \ to pen use was 7.3 (95% CI: 6.2-8.4, P < 0.001) - an increase of 51.6%. CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ The checklist resulted in doctors providing significantly more education applicable\
  \ to syringe and insulin pen routes of insulin administration during simulations.\
  \ Further research is needed on the checklist's impact on healthcare professionals\
  \ and patient outcomes in the clinical context. (Clinical Trials Registry No: NCT02266303)."
