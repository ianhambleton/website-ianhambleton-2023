abstract: 'Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a genetic condition which manifests as altered
  hemoglobin (Hb) protein that can aggregate under hypoxic conditions. The resultant
  sickled erythrocytes experience premature hemolysis, releasing an estimated 10g
  of free Hb (fHb) into the intravascular space. FHb participates in redox reactions
  creating various reactive oxygen species which rapidly and irreversibly scavenge
  nitric oxide, thereby attenuating its vasodilatory, antithrombotic, and anti-inflammatory
  properties. FHb also induces endothelial expression of adhesion molecules, triggering
  leukocyte margination at the vessel wall. These mechanisms participate in diverse
  SCD-associated clinical events including nephropathy, pulmonary hypertension, chronic
  leg ulceration, and ischemic events. FHb also exerts a direct reno-toxic effect
  contributing to albuminuria which is an early, frequent manifestation of glomerular
  injury. Under normal conditions, fHb is effectively scavenged by the Hb-scavenging
  mechanism (HSM); this involves binding to haptoglobin (Hp), uptake via the Hb-scavenging
  receptor (CD163) on monocytes and metabolism by heme-oxygenase-1. This culminates
  in increased CD163 expression and release of anti-inflammatory by-products e.g.
  interleukin-10 (IL-10). In SCD, the Hb-binding capacity is overwhelmed by chronic
  hemolysis; our previous research shows serum Hp as the depleted component. This
  deficiency could result in the harmful consequences of circulating fHb going unbridled.
  The hypothesis we explore here is that Hp infusions, in excess of fHb concentration,
  will allow the HSM to remain functional, and thereby achieve improved clinical outcomes,
  tracking albuminuria as a sentinel. Albuminuria was selected because of its high
  prevalence in SCD and its relative ease of diagnosis and monitoring. The hypothesis
  may be evaluated in four phases: Phase 1 will determine the concentration of Hp
  needed to trigger the HSM as measured by induction of CD163 and IL-10 and the recovery
  of hemopexin. Phase 2 will investigate the half-life of HSM induction by analyzing
  the time-course of CD163 expression and IL-10 and hemopexin serum concentration.
  Phase 3 will determine patient eligibility for therapy, whether as treatment or
  prevention. Phase 4 will test the efficacy of Hp transfusions in a randomized control
  trial as measured by correction of albuminuria. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
  (ACEi) are currently the first-line treatment for SCD nephropathy, however hyperkalemia
  limits its use. Hydroxyurea, which has therapeutic value in many SCD adverse events,
  has yielded inconsistent effects on albuminuria. We are proposing the addition of
  an intervention more proximal in the hemolytic cascade. Boosting the exhausted Hb-scavenging
  capacity via Hp replacement therapy has the potential to modify multiple downstream
  clinical events.'
