abstract: 'IMPORTANCE: A surge in severe cases of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019)
  in children would present unique challenges for hospitals and public health preparedness
  efforts in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence-based estimates of
  children infected with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
  2) and projected cumulative numbers of severely ill pediatric COVID-19 cases requiring
  hospitalization during the US 2020 pandemic. DESIGN: Empirical case projection study.
  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted pediatric severity proportions and adjusted
  pediatric criticality proportions were derived from clinical and spatiotemporal
  modeling studies of the COVID-19 epidemic in China for the period January-February
  2020. Estimates of total children infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States
  through April 6, 2020, were calculated using US pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)
  cases and the adjusted pediatric criticality proportion. Projected numbers of severely
  and critically ill children with COVID-19 were derived by applying the adjusted
  severity and criticality proportions to US population data, under several scenarios
  of cumulative pediatric infection proportion (CPIP). RESULTS: By April 6, 2020,
  there were 74 children who had been reported admitted to PICUs in 19 states, reflecting
  an estimated 176 190 children nationwide infected with SARS-CoV-2 (52 381 infants
  and toddlers younger than 2 years, 42 857 children aged 2-11 years, and 80 952 children
  aged 12-17 years). Under a CPIP scenario of 5%, there would be 3.7 million children
  infected with SARS-CoV-2, 9907 severely ill children requiring hospitalization,
  and 1086 critically ill children requiring PICU admission. Under a CPIP scenario
  of 50%, 10 865 children would require PICU admission, 99 073 would require hospitalization
  for severe pneumonia, and 37.0 million would be infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS
  AND RELEVANCE: Because there are 74.0 million children 0 to 17 years old in the
  United States, the projected numbers of severe cases could overextend available
  pediatric hospital care resources under several moderate CPIP scenarios for 2020
  despite lower severity of COVID-19 in children than in adults.'
