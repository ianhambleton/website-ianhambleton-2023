abstract: "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among women\
  \ in the Caribbean and accounts for >1 million disability adjusted life years. Little\
  \ is known about the social inequalities of this disease in the Caribbean. In support\
  \ of the Rio Political Declaration on addressing health inequities, this article\
  \ presents a systematic review of evidence on the distribution, by social determinants,\
  \ of breast cancer risk factors, frequency, and adverse outcomes in Caribbean women.\
  \ METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciELO, CINAHL, CUMED, LILACS, and IBECS were searched\
  \ for observational studies reporting associations between social determinants and\
  \ breast cancer risk factors, frequency, or outcomes. Based on the PROGRESS-plus\
  \ checklist, we considered 8 social determinant groups for 14 breast cancer endpoints,\
  \ which totalled to 189 possible ways ('relationship groups') to explore the role\
  \ of social determinants on breast cancer. Studies with >50 participants conducted\
  \ in Caribbean territories between 2004 and 2014 were eligible for inclusion. The\
  \ review was conducted according to STROBE and PRISMA guidelines and results were\
  \ planned as a narrative synthesis, with meta-analysis if possible. RESULTS: Thirty-four\
  \ articles were included from 5,190 screened citations. From these included studies,\
  \ 75 inequality relationships were reported examining 30 distinct relationship groups,\
  \ leaving 84% of relationship groups unexplored. Most inequality relationships were\
  \ reported for risk factors, particularly alcohol and overweight/obesity which generally\
  \ showed a positive relationship with indicators of lower socioeconomic position.\
  \ Evidence for breast cancer frequency and outcomes was scarce. Unmarried women\
  \ tended to have a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with breast cancer when\
  \ compared to married women. While no association was observed between breast cancer\
  \ frequency and ethnicity, mortality from breast cancer was shown to be slightly\
  \ higher among Asian-Indian compared to African-descent populations in Trinidad\
  \ (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.4) and Guyana (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6). CONCLUSION: Study\
  \ quantity, quality, and variability in outcomes and reporting limited the synthesis\
  \ of evidence on the role of social determinants on breast cancer in the Caribbean.\
  \ This report represents important current evidence on the region, and can guide\
  \ future research priorities for better describing and understanding of Caribbean\
  \ breast cancer inequalities."
