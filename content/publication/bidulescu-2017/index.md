abstract: "BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that social inequalities in chronic\
  \ disease outcomes differ between industrialized and developing countries, but few\
  \ have directly compared these effects. We explored inequalities in hypertension\
  \ and diabetes prevalence between African-descent populations with different levels\
  \ of educational attainment in Jamaica and in the United States of America (USA),\
  \ comparing disparities within each location, and between countries. METHODS: We\
  \ analyzed baseline data from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) in the USA and Spanish\
  \ Town Cohort (STC) in Jamaica. Participants reported their highest level of educational\
  \ attainment, which was categorized as 'less than high school' (<HS), high school\
  \ (HS) and 'more than high school' (>HS). Educational disparities in the prevalence\
  \ of hypertension and diabetes were examined using prevalence ratios (PR), controlling\
  \ for age, sex and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: Analyses included 7248 participants,\
  \ 2382 from STC and 4866 from JHS, with mean age of 47 and 54 years, respectively\
  \ (p < 0.001). Prevalence for both hypertension and diabetes was significantly higher\
  \ in the JHS compared to STC, 62% vs. 25% (p < 0.001) and 18% vs. 13% (p < 0.001),\
  \ respectively. In bivariate analyses there were significant disparities by education\
  \ level for both hypertension and diabetes in both studies; however, after accounting\
  \ for confounding or interaction by age, sex and BMI these effects were attenuated.\
  \ For hypertension, after adjusting for age and BMI, a significant education disparity\
  \ was found only for women in JHS, with PR of 1.10 (95% CI 1.04-1.16) for < HS vs > HS\
  \ and 1.07 (95% CI 1.01-1.13) for HS vs > HS. For diabetes; when considering age-group\
  \ and sex specific estimates adjusted for BMI, among men: significant associations\
  \ were seen only in the 45-59 years age-group in JHS with PR 1.84 (95% CI 1.16-2.91)\
  \ for < HS vs > HS. Among women, significant PR comparing < HS to > HS was seen\
  \ for all three age-groups for JHS, but not in STC; PR were 3.95 (95% CI 1.94-8.05),\
  \ 1.53 (95% CI 1.10-2.11) and 1.32 (95% CI 1.06-1.64) for 25-44, 45-59 and 60-74\
  \ age-groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: In Jamaica, educational disparities were\
  \ largely explained by age, sex and BMI, while in the USA these disparities were\
  \ larger and persisted after accounting these variables."
