abstract: "1. In homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease, skin cooling is a common precipitating\
  \ factor of the painful crisis which is associated with avascular necrosis of active\
  \ bone marrow. Since skin cooling does not directly induce sickling, we have investigated\
  \ the nature of the reflex vascular responses to mild cooling in SS patients in\
  \ a steady state of the disease and compared them with their history of painful\
  \ crises. 2. Experiments were performed in Jamaica on 60 male SS patients and 30\
  \ matched control subjects with normal haemoglobin (AA) genotype. Forearm blood\
  \ flow (FBF) was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography and mean arterial\
  \ pressure (MAP) by a Finapres device: forearm vascular resistance (FVR) was calculated\
  \ as MAP/FBF. Cutaneous erythrocyte flux in forearm and hand was monitored by a\
  \ laser Doppler meter. The contralateral hand was immersed in cool water at 16 degrees\
  \ C for 2 min, 6 times, at random intervals of 0.5-3 min. 3. The first cool immersion\
  \ evoked an increase in MAP, cutaneous vasoconstriction and a net increase in FVR\
  \ in both AA and SS subjects. However, the direction of change in FVR varied between\
  \ individuals such that 18 AA subjects showed an increase in FVR (constrictor group)\
  \ while 12 showed a decrease in FVR, indicating vasodilatation in forearm muscle\
  \ (dilator group). In contrast, 50 SS subjects showed an increase in FVR and only\
  \ 10 showed a decrease in FVR. The proportion of subjects who showed net vasoconstriction\
  \ was significantly greater in the SS than in the AA group (83% versus 60%, P =\
  \ 0.03, chi 2 test). 4. By the sixth cool stimulus, the 'dilator' group of AA subjects\
  \ showed no change in FVR while the 'dilator' group of SS patients showed an increase\
  \ in FVR. We suggest that forearm muscle vasodilatation was the characteristic component\
  \ of the alerting/defence response to novel or noxious stimuli which habituates\
  \ on repetition. 5. In the whole group of SS patients, baseline values of cutaneous\
  \ vascular resistance and FVR increased between stimuli, indicating persistent vasoconstriction,\
  \ and the sixth cool stimulus still evoked cutaneous vasoconstriction and a net\
  \ increase in FVR. In contrast, AA subjects showed an increase in baseline FVR between\
  \ stimuli, but the sixth cool stimulus had no significant effect on cutaneous vascular\
  \ resistances, or FVR. 6. In SS patients there were no associations between the\
  \ direction of change in FVR evoked by the first cool stimulus and forearm circumference\
  \ or skinfold thickness, concentrations of haemoglobin or fetal haemoglobin. However,\
  \ the frequency of painful crises was significantly greater in the 'constrictor'\
  \ group than in the 'dilator' group (0.36 versus 0.12/year, P = 0.04, Mann-Whitney\
  \ test). 7. These results indicate that the primary reflex vasoconstrictor response\
  \ evoked by mild cooling is stronger and more persistent in SS patients than in\
  \ AA subjects and is particularly strong in SS patients who are most prone to painful\
  \ crises. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that skin cooling may precipitate\
  \ the painful crisis by causing reflex vasoconstriction in muscle, and possibly\
  \ in bone marrow, so diverting blood flow away from the active marrow."
