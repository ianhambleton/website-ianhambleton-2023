abstract: The aim of this study was to provide standards for the assessment of birthweight,
  head circumference and crown-heel length for normal, singleton newborns of predominantly
  West African descent. Data were collected for 10 482 or 94% of all recorded births
  in Jamaica during the two-month period September 1 to October 31, 1986. After editing
  procedures, data were available for 6178 (birthweight), 5975 (head circumference),
  and 5990 (crown-heel length). The data presented in tables and growth curves include
  birthweight, head circumference and crown-heel length for males and females separately,
  for gestational ages 30-43 weeks. Data sets from the University Hospital of the
  West Indies in 1990 and 1999 were used to explore the possibility of secular change
  over the period 1986-1999. In conclusion, these ethnic and gender-specific growth
  curves are based on the most extensive dataset currently available in Jamaica for
  babies of West African descent.
