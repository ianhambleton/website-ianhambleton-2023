abstract: In India, the Chhattisgarh State screening programme for sickle haemoglobin
  focuses on children aged 3-15 years and has screened over 1,050,440 subjects over
  the last 6 years. Commencing in the District around the capital Raipur, this programme
  has now completed screening in 7 of the 27 Districts of Chhattisgarh State. Screening
  is initially performed by solubility tests on fingerprick samples in the field and
  those with positive tests have venipunctures for haemoglobin electrophoresis. The
  frequency of the sickle cell trait was 9.64 % and of the SS phenotype 0.29 % with
  only two Districts in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, most Districts showing an excess
  of the SS 'phenotype' most readily explained by symptomatic selection. The estimated
  costs were US$0.28 (solubility tests alone) and US$0.60 (haemoglobin electrophoresis).
  Of the social groupings commonly used in India, the OBC's (other backward classes)
  had the highest frequencies of the sickle cell gene mutations, followed by the Scheduled
  Tribes and the Scheduled Castes. The objectives of the programme were the detection
  of sickle cell disease for prospective clinical management and of the sickle cell
  trait for purposes of genetic counselling. The former objective is being met for
  diagnosis although the success of referral to clinic services requires audit. The
  objective of genetic counselling is compromised by the failure of the screening
  test to detect other genes of potential clinical significance such as HbD Punjab
  and the beta thalassaemia trait. Despite these exceptions, the detection of HbS
  appears relatively robust and could be another condition factored into the traditions
  of partner selection amongst the underprivileged communities of this state. Overall,
  the Chhattisgarh programme seeks to address the daunting challenges of large populations
  carrying the sickle cell gene and maybe a useful model for elsewhere.
