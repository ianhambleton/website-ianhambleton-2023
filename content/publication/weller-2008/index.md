abstract: 'BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that voluntary counselling and testing during
  pregnancy are necessary but not sufficient to provide the holistic psychosocial
  support needed by Jamaican women living with HIV and/or AIDS. Based on this hypothesis,
  we investigated a range of coping methods and support systems used by HIV-infected
  women and a group of their HIV-negative counterparts before, during and immediately
  after their pregnancies. METHODS: Women attending obstetric clinics in urban Jamaica
  completed a quantitative survey aimed at discovering coping behaviours, social and
  spiritual support systems. Pre-survey focus group studies and key informant interviews
  contributed to the design of the questionnaire while post-survey focus groups were
  used to probe the validity of the data gleaned from the questionnaire survey Survey
  data were analyzed using non-parametric tests for trend with independent univariate
  tests. RESULTS: Fifty-five HIV-infected women and 51 HIV-negative women completed
  the survey Compared with HIV-negative women, more HIV-infected women reported both
  feeling depressed (p = 0.07) and having difficulty concentrating (p = 0.05) during
  the month immediately prior to the study. Other statistically significant differences
  included: HIV-infected women were more likely to pray, to sleep and to change eating
  habits in response to worry and stress (p = 0.001 in each instance). Although several
  women declared religious faith, significantly fewer HIV-infected women were willing
  to talk to a religious leader about their problems compared to their HIV-negative
  counterparts (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Participation of HIV-infected women in post-survey
  focus groups augmented the survey findings. Many of the women reported negative
  emotions and some indicated serious challenges in accessing social support. The
  results point to the need for systematic documentation of psychosocial profiles
  as part of the approach to caring for these women. In addition, in the Jamaican
  sociocultural context, we recommend improved training of religious leaders and healthcare
  providers in psychosocial issues.'
