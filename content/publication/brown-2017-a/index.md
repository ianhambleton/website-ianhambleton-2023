abstract: "BACKGROUND: Depressive disorder is the largest contributor to years lived\
  \ with disability in the Caribbean, adding 948 per 100,000 in 2013. Depression is\
  \ also a major risk factor for suicidal behaviour. Social inequalities influence\
  \ the occurrence of depression, yet little is known about the social inequalities\
  \ of this condition in the Caribbean. In support of the 2011 Rio Political Declaration\
  \ on addressing health inequities, this article presents a systematic review of\
  \ the role of social determinants on depression and its suicidal behaviours in the\
  \ Caribbean. METHODS: Eight databases were searched for observational studies reporting\
  \ associations between social determinants and depression frequency, severity, or\
  \ outcomes. Based on the PROGRESS-plus checklist, we considered 9 social determinant\
  \ groups (of 15 endpoints) for 6 depression endpoints, totalling 90 possible ways\
  \ ('relationship groups') to explore the role of social determinants on depression.\
  \ Studies with â‰¥50 participants conducted in Caribbean territories between 2004\
  \ and 2014 were eligible. The review was conducted according to STROBE and PRISMA\
  \ guidelines. Results were planned as a narrative synthesis, with meta-analysis\
  \ if possible. RESULTS: From 3951 citations, 55 articles from 45 studies were included.\
  \ Most were classified as serious risk of bias. Fifty-seven relationship groups\
  \ were reported by the 55 included articles, leaving 33 relationship groups (37%)\
  \ without an evidence base. Most associations were reported for gender, age, residence,\
  \ marital status, and education. Depression, its severity, and its outcomes were\
  \ more common among females (except suicide which was more common among males),\
  \ early and middle adolescents (among youth), and those with lower levels of education.\
  \ Marriage emerged as both a risk and protective factor for depression score and\
  \ prevalence, while several inequality relationships in Haiti were in contrast to\
  \ typical trends. CONCLUSION: The risk of bias and few numbers of studies within\
  \ relationship groups restricted the synthesis of Caribbean evidence on social inequalities\
  \ of depression. Along with more research focusing on regional social inequalities,\
  \ attempts at standardizing reporting guidelines for observational studies of inequality\
  \ and studies examining depression is necessitated. This review offers as a benchmark\
  \ to prioritize future research into the social determinants of depression frequency\
  \ and outcomes in the Caribbean."
