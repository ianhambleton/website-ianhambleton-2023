abstract: "BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of surgery\
  \ for Blount disease using a patient-derived outcome assessment. Our hypothesis\
  \ was that an outcome score that quantitates the patient's level of satisfaction\
  \ should correlate with specific ranges of correction for those radiologic variables\
  \ traditionally used to evaluate Blount disease. The surgeon's aim should be to\
  \ realign abnormal preoperative geometry to achieve those ranges that have a significant\
  \ correlation with good outcome. METHODS: Medical records from 2 hospitals (Barbados\
  \ and Trinidad) were reviewed and patients who had surgery for Blount's from 1997\
  \ to 2005 were identified and recalled. Responders completed a Blount's Outcome\
  \ Questionnaire, were examined clinically, and standing radiographs were taken.\
  \ The questionnaire was designed by modifying the AAOS Pediatrics-Parent/Child Outcome\
  \ Instrument. Linear regression was used to assess the predictive effect of selected\
  \ radiographic measures on a visual analog pain score and satisfaction score calculated\
  \ from the questionnaire. The model was adjusted for confounders: country, age at\
  \ the time of study, sex, body mass index, and years postsurgery. Variables in the\
  \ adjusted model achieving significance at P<0.05 were included in a multiple regression\
  \ analysis. RESULTS: Fifty knees in 41 patients were included. The median satisfaction\
  \ score was 93%. The metaphyseal-diaphyseal angle (MDA) and anatomical femoral-tibial\
  \ angle (aFTA), both had a quadratic effect on the pain score (P<0.001). The predicted\
  \ pain score was minimized at the MDA range of 0 to -10 degrees and at the aFTA\
  \ range of 0 to +5 degrees. A significant effect on the satisfaction score was noted\
  \ for MDA (P=0.02) and aFTA (P<0.001) with scores maximized at the MDA range of\
  \ +5 to -5 degrees and at positive aFTA (valgus angulation). For women the satisfaction\
  \ scores were lower and the pain scores higher. Overweight patients had higher pain\
  \ scores. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this evaluation of the association between patient\
  \ outcome scores (for pain and satisfaction) and postoperative clinical and radiologic\
  \ variables support the recommendation that surgical correction should aim at producing\
  \ an MDA score between -5 and +5 degrees and a valgus alignment with an aFTA score\
  \ of 0 to 5 degrees. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic study, investigating the results\
  \ of treatment. Level III."
