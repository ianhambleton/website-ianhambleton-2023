abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To determine the mortality rate after diabetes-related lower-extremity
  amputation (LEA) in an African-descent Caribbean population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
  METHODS: We conducted a prospective case-control study. We recruited case subjects
  (with diabetes and LEA) and age-matched control subjects (with diabetes and no LEA)
  between 1999 and 2001. We followed these groups for 5 years to assess mortality
  risk and causes. RESULTS: There were 205 amputations (123 minor and 82 major). The
  1-year and 5-year survival rates were 69 and 44% among case subjects and 97 and
  82% among control subjects (case-control difference, P < 0.001). The mortality rates
  (per 1,000 person-years) were 273.9 (95% CI 207.1-362.3) after a major amputation,
  113.4 (85.2-150.9) after a minor amputation, and 36.4 (25.6-51.8) among control
  subjects. Sepsis and cardiac disease were the most common causes of death. CONCLUSIONS:
  These mortality rates are the highest reported worldwide. Interventions to limit
  sepsis and complications from cardiac disease offer a huge potential for improving
  post-LEA survival in this vulnerable group.'
