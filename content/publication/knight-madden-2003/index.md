abstract: "BACKGROUND: Bronchodilators are used to treat bronchial hyper-responsiveness\
  \ in asthma. Bronchial hyper-responsiveness may be a component of the acute chest\
  \ syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. Therefore, bronchodilators may be\
  \ useful in the treatment of acute chest syndrome. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits\
  \ and risks associated with the use of bronchodilators in people with acute chest\
  \ syndrome. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic\
  \ Disorders Group trials register which comprises references identified from comprehensive\
  \ electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstract books\
  \ of conference proceedings. Additional searches were carried out on MEDLINE (1966\
  \ to 2002) and EMBASE (1981 to 2002).Date of the most recent search of the Group's\
  \ haemoglobinopathies register: May 2002. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised\
  \ controlled trials. Trials using quasi-randomisation methods will be included in\
  \ future updates of this review if there is sufficient evidence that the treatment\
  \ and control groups are similar at baseline. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We found\
  \ no trials investigating the use of bronchodilators for acute chest syndrome in\
  \ people with sickle cell disease. MAIN RESULTS: We found no trials investigating\
  \ the use of bronchodilators for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell\
  \ disease. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: If bronchial hyper-responsiveness is an important\
  \ component of some episodes of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell\
  \ disease, the use of inhaled bronchodilators may be indicated. There is need for\
  \ a well-designed, adequately powered randomised controlled trial to assess the\
  \ benefits and risks of the addition of inhaled bronchodilators to established therapies\
  \ for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease."
