abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To raise awareness of significant iron deficiency anaemia occurring
  in Jamaican secondary school students. METHODS: Haematological screening of students
  in the fifth and sixth forms of 14 secondary schools in the parishes of Manchester
  and Clarendon, Jamaica, was done. Samples were subject to haemoglobin electrophoresis,
  examination of haematological indices, and haemoglobin, alpha 2 (HbA2) levels where
  indicated. RESULTS: Of 13 172 students with normal haemoglobin (AA) genotype aged
  15-19 years, haemoglobin levels below 10 g/dL occurred in 0.36% of males and in
  3.79% females. These subjects had low mean red cell volumes, low mean cell haemoglobin
  and high red cell distribution width, characteristic of iron deficiency, which was
  confirmed by dramatic increases in haemoglobin level following iron supplementation.
  Most revealed classic symptoms, histories of poor diets and pica, which generally
  resolved on iron supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Iron deficiency, even in the absence
  of anaemia, is known to limit physical and mental functions and may impair intellectual
  performance in these high school students. Significant anaemia could be detected
  by incorporating a blood test into the school medical assessments performed on entry
  to secondary schools. There is a need for simple oral iron medications to be available
  at health centres.'
