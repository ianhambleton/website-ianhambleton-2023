abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Small vessel disease is more common in Afro-Caribbeans than
  Caucasians. We investigated underlying differences in metabolic, inflammatory, and
  vascular responses that may predispose Afro-Caribbeans to small vessel pathology.
  METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-eight Afro-Caribbeans aged 35-75 years, with no vascular
  disease or medications, were compared with 82 matched Caucasians for metabolic variables,
  fasting insulin, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, and cytoplasmic
  repressor protein levels. Carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) was measured ultrasonographically.
  Small vessel function was assessed by measuring the absolute change from baseline
  in the reflectance index (RI) of the digital volume pulse during IV infusion of
  albuterol (5 microg/min, DeltaRIALB) and glyceryl tri nitrate (5 microg/min, DeltaRIGTN).
  Large artery elasticity was measured as the stiffness index (SI) and derived from
  the time to pulse wave reflection adjusted for subject height. Afro-Caribbeans had
  significantly higher diastolic blood pressure (80.3 versus 77.6 mm Hg; P=0.033),
  fasting insulin (14.0 versus 10.6 microU/mL; P=0.026), TNF-alpha (6.7 versus 4.3;
  pg/mL; P=0.001), and interleukin 6 (2.3 versus 1.5 pg/mL; P=0.036) levels compared
  with Caucasians. CIMT was greater (0.81+/-0.20 versus 0.75+/-0.18 mm; P=0.02) and
  small vessel reactivity attenuated (mean DeltaRIALB 6.8+/-8.0% versus 12.3+/-8.%;
  P<0.0001) in Afro-Caribbeans, but their large artery elasticity (mean index of large
  artery stiffness 9.9 versus 9.7 m/s; P=0.48) was comparable with Caucasians. CIMT
  was independently associated with an index of large artery stiffness (beta=0.03;
  P=0.002) in Caucasians but not in Afro-Caribbeans. There were independent relationships
  among Afro-Caribbean ethnicity, TNF-alpha, and insulin levels. CONCLUSIONS: Selective
  impairment of small artery function may contribute to excess small vessel disease
  in Afro-Caribbeans.'
