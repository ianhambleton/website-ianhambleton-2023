abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To provide baseline information on tobacco use among adolescents
  in the Caribbean for the period before country-level implementation of the Framework
  Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO-FCTC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Global Youth
  Tobacco Surveys (GYTS) between 2000 and 2008, we report baseline prevalence, 5-year
  change, and disparities in tobacco use (ever smoked, currently smoke) among adolescents.
  RESULTS: The Caribbean prevalence of ever-smoked fell from 33.3 to 29.0% with nine
  of 14 countries reporting a 5-year decrease, and the prevalence of current smokers
  fell from 12.1 to 11.7% with eight of 14 countries reporting a 5-year decrease.
  Between-country disparities in the prevalence of ever smoked decreased, while between-country
  disparities in currently smoked saw little change. CONCLUSIONS: This regional summary
  of tobacco use provides baseline estimates of adolescent smoking, and cross-country
  smoking disparities for the period before MPOWER implementation. Subsequent GYTS
  survey rounds can be used to monitor program success.'
