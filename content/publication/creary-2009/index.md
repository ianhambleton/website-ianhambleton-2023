abstract: High levels of fetal haemoglobin (HbF) are protective in beta-haemoglobinopathies.
  The proportion of erythrocytes containing HbF (F-cells, FC) was measured in healthy
  adults of African and Caucasian ancestry to assess the feasibility of localizing
  genes for the FC trait using admixture mapping. Participants were Afro-Caribbean
  (AC) blood donors and residents of a rural enclave with a history of recent German
  admixture (Afro-German, AG) recruited in Jamaica, and Caucasian Europeans recruited
  in Jamaica and the UK. FC levels were significantly different between groups (P
  < 0.001); the geometric mean FC level in the AC sample (n = 176) was 3.75% [95%
  confidence interval (CI) 3.36-4.18], AG sample (n = 631) was 2.77% (95% CI 2.63-2.92),
  and among Caucasians (n = 1099) was 3.26% (95% CI 3.13-3.39). After adjustment for
  age, sex, haemoglobin electrophoresis pattern, and HBG2 genotype, FC levels in the
  AC group remained significantly different (P < 0.001) from those in the Caucasian
  and the AG group but the difference between the Caucasian and AG groups became non-significant
  (P = 0.46) despite substantial differences in average ancestry. The data confirm
  ethnic differences in FC levels and indicate the potential usefulness of these populations
  for admixture mapping of genes for FC levels.
