abstract: "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence and risk\
  \ factors for intergenerational (IG)-sex in females aged 15-19 residing in Barbados.\
  \ METHODS: This cross sectional cluster survey was conducted in a 2.6% national\
  \ sample in the age range (n = 261) recruited from multiple polling districts chosen\
  \ with a probability proportional to size. Consent was obtained from participants\
  \ aged ≥18 years or from parents/guardians of participants <18 years, with participant\
  \ assent. The prevalence of age at first sex was analyzed using a life table approach\
  \ and risk factors for IG sex (defined as sexual relations with a male 10 or more\
  \ years older) were analyzed by logistic regression, adjusting for age. RESULTS:\
  \ 51.0% of adolescent females in the survey reported ever having had sex, among\
  \ whom prevalence of IG-sex was 13.2% (95% CI: 6.7-19.8) at first sex, 29.0% (22.3-35.7)\
  \ within the preceding twelve months, and 34.8% (24.3-45.4) ever. Condom use at\
  \ first sex was positively related to willingness to have sex (F statistic = 9.8,\
  \ p = 0.001). The strongest determinant for IG-sex was age of sexual debut (age\
  \ adjusted Odds Ratio [95% CI]: 0.58[0.41-0.83]), followed by money or gifts received\
  \ from the partner (2.91[1.17-7.23] and self-esteem (0.33[0.11-0.95]). CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ The survey establishes a high rate of IG-sex in Barbados, a 'high income' country.\
  \ Most insightful is that risk of IG-sex nearly halved for every year at which first\
  \ sex was delayed. A high proportion of coerced sex was reported at first sexual\
  \ experience and this was linked to poor condom use. Affirmative prevention approaches\
  \ are recommended to boost self-acclamation of adolescent women within less coercive\
  \ relationships, especially during their first sexual encounter."
