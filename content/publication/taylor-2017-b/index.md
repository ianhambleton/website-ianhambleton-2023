abstract: 'AIMS: With regards to insulin initiation in Barbados we explored primary
  care doctor (PCD) perception, healthcare system factors and predictors of PCD reluctance
  to initiate insulin. METHODS: PCDs completed a questionnaire based on the theory
  of planned behaviour (TPB) and a reluctance to initiate insulin scale. Using linear
  regression, we explored the association between TPB domains and the reluctance to
  initiate insulin scale. RESULTS: Of 161 PCDs, 70% responded (75 private and 37 public
  sector). The majority felt initiating insulin was uncomplicated (68%) and there
  was benefit if used before complications developed (68%), but would not use it until
  absolutely necessary (58%). More private than public sector PCDs (p<0.05) thought
  that the healthcare system allowed enough flexibility of time for education (68
  vs 38%) and initiating insulin was easy (63 vs 35%), but less thought system changes
  would help initiating insulin (42 vs 70%). Reasons for reluctance to initiate insulin
  included patient nonadherence (83%) and reluctance (63%). Only the attitudes and
  belief domain of the TPB was associated with the reluctance to initiate insulin
  scale (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Interventions focusing on PCD attitudes and beliefs
  and restructuring services inclusive of the use of diabetes specialist nurses are
  required.'
