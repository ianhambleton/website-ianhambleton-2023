abstract: We describe breast cancer incidence and mortality in the predominantly African-origin
  population of Barbados, which shares an ancestral origin with African-Americans.
  Age-standardized incidence rates were calculated from histologically confirmed breast
  cancer cases identified during a 45-month period (July 2002-March 2006). Mortality
  rates were estimated from death registrations over 10-years starting January 1995.
  There were 396 incident cases of breast cancer for an incidence rate of 78.1 (95%
  confidence interval (CI) 70.5-86.3), standardized to the US population. Breast cancer
  incidence in African-Americans between 2000 and 2004 was 143.7 (142.0-145.5) per
  100,000. Incidence peaked at 226.6 (174.5-289.4) per 100,000 among Barbadian women
  aged 50-54 years, and declined thereafter, a pattern in marked contrast to trends
  in African-American women, whose rates continued to increase to a peak of 483.5
  per 100,000 in those aged 75-79 years. Incidence rate ratios comparing Barbadian
  and African-American women showed no statistically significant differences among
  women aged>or=55 years (p<or=0.001 at all older ages). The age-standardized mortality
  rate in Barbados was 32.9 (29.9-36.0) per 100,000; similar to reported US rates.
  The pattern of diverging breast cancer incidence between Barbadian and African-American
  women may suggest a greater contribution from genetic factors in younger women,
  and from environmental factors in older women. Studies in intermediate risk populations,
  such as Barbados, may assist the understanding of racial disparities in breast cancer.
