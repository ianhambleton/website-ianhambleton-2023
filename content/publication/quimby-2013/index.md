abstract: In Barbados, use of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Disease Activity
  Index (SLEDAI) is limited by the unavailability of serologic markers. The SLE Activity
  Questionnaire (SLAQ) excludes laboratory measurements and is therefore more accessible.
  Here, we investigate the agreement between the SLAQ, the SLEDAI, and the physician
  global assessment (PGA). A pilot of 32 participants completed the SLAQ and SLEDAI.
  The tools were compared (1) in their original format, (2) limited to common indices,
  and (3) limited to the same patient recall period. We compared the proportions of
  persons reporting disease activity and the concordance between calculated activity
  scores for SLAQ versus SLEDAI and for SLAQ versus PGA. Seventy-eight percent versus
  59% of participants reported disease activity with the original SLEDAI versus SLAQ,
  respectively. The relationship was reversed to 22% versus 59% when the matched item
  tools were compared. Concordance was 0.62 (95% CI 0.42-0.81) between the original
  scores, 0.70 (0.57-0.83) when restricted by matched items, and 0.72 (0.59-0.84)
  when further restricted by recall period. Concordance between the SLAQ and PGA was
  0.56 (0.32-0.80). Reversal of the disease activity percentage in the matched items
  comparison highlights the inadequacy of tools that exclude laboratory measurements
  and suggests that the subjective nature of SLAQ may contribute to over-reporting.
  Further work is needed to produce a robust disease activity tool apt for resource-constrained
  environments.
