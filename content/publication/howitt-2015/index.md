abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To describe the distribution of diabetes, hypertension and related
  behavioural and biological risk factors in adults in Barbados by gender, education
  and occupation. DESIGN: Multistage probability sampling was used to select a representative
  sample of the adult population (â‰¥ 25 years). Participants were interviewed using
  standard questionnaires, underwent anthropometric and blood pressure measurements,
  and provided fasting blood for glucose and cholesterol measurements. Standard WHO
  definitions were used. Data were weighted for sampling and non-response, and were
  age and sex standardised to the 2010 Barbados population. Weighted prevalence estimates
  were calculated, and prevalence ratios were calculated for behavioural and biological
  risk factors by demographic and socioeconomic group. RESULTS: Study response rate
  was 55.0%, with 764 women, 470 men. Prevalence of obesity was 33.8% (95% CI 30.7%
  to 37.1%); hypertension 40.6% (95% CI 36.5% to 44.9%); and diabetes 18.7% (95% CI
  16.2% to 21.4%). Compared with women, men were less likely to be obese (prevalence
  ratio 0.5; 95% CI 0.4 to 0.7), or physically inactive (0.5; 0.4 to 0.6), but more
  likely to smoke tobacco (4.1; 2.5 to 6.7) and consume large amounts of alcohol in
  a single episode (4.6; 2.7 to 7.6). Both diabetes (0.83; 0.65 to 1.05) and hypertension
  (0.89; 0.79 to 1.02) were lower in men, but not significantly so. In women, higher
  educational level was related to higher fruit and vegetable intake, more physical
  activity, less diabetes and less hypercholesterolaemia (p 0.01-0.04). In men, higher
  education was related only to less smoking (p 0.04). Differences by occupation were
  limited to smoking in men and hypercholesterolaemia in women. CONCLUSIONS: In this
  developing country population, sex appears to be a much stronger determinant of
  behavioural risk factors, as well as obesity and its related risks, than education
  or occupation. These findings have implications for meeting the commitments made
  in the 2011 Rio Political Declaration, to eliminate health inequities.'
