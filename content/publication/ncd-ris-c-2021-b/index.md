abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Hypertension can be detected at the primary health-care level
  and low-cost treatments can effectively control hypertension. We aimed to measure
  the prevalence of hypertension and progress in its detection, treatment, and control
  from 1990 to 2019 for 200 countries and territories. METHODS: We used data from
  1990 to 2019 on people aged 30-79 years from population-representative studies with
  measurement of blood pressure and data on blood pressure treatment. We defined hypertension
  as having systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or greater, diastolic blood pressure
  90 mm Hg or greater, or taking medication for hypertension. We applied a Bayesian
  hierarchical model to estimate the prevalence of hypertension and the proportion
  of people with hypertension who had a previous diagnosis (detection), who were taking
  medication for hypertension (treatment), and whose hypertension was controlled to
  below 140/90 mm Hg (control). The model allowed for trends over time to be non-linear
  and to vary by age. FINDINGS: The number of people aged 30-79 years with hypertension
  doubled from 1990 to 2019, from 331 (95% credible interval 306-359) million women
  and 317 (292-344) million men in 1990 to 626 (584-668) million women and 652 (604-698)
  million men in 2019, despite stable global age-standardised prevalence. In 2019,
  age-standardised hypertension prevalence was lowest in Canada and Peru for both
  men and women; in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and some countries in western Europe
  including Switzerland, Spain, and the UK for women; and in several low-income and
  middle-income countries such as Eritrea, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Solomon Islands
  for men. Hypertension prevalence surpassed 50% for women in two countries and men
  in nine countries, in central and eastern Europe, central Asia, Oceania, and Latin
  America. Globally, 59% (55-62) of women and 49% (46-52) of men with hypertension
  reported a previous diagnosis of hypertension in 2019, and 47% (43-51) of women
  and 38% (35-41) of men were treated. Control rates among people with hypertension
  in 2019 were 23% (20-27) for women and 18% (16-21) for men. In 2019, treatment and
  control rates were highest in South Korea, Canada, and Iceland (treatment >70%;
  control >50%), followed by the USA, Costa Rica, Germany, Portugal, and Taiwan. Treatment
  rates were less than 25% for women and less than 20% for men in Nepal, Indonesia,
  and some countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. Control rates were below 10%
  for women and men in these countries and for men in some countries in north Africa,
  central and south Asia, and eastern Europe. Treatment and control rates have improved
  in most countries since 1990, but we found little change in most countries in sub-Saharan
  Africa and Oceania. Improvements were largest in high-income countries, central
  Europe, and some upper-middle-income and recently high-income countries including
  Costa Rica, Taiwan, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, and Iran. INTERPRETATION:
  Improvements in the detection, treatment, and control of hypertension have varied
  substantially across countries, with some middle-income countries now outperforming
  most high-income nations. The dual approach of reducing hypertension prevalence
  through primary prevention and enhancing its treatment and control is achievable
  not only in high-income countries but also in low-income and middle-income settings.
