abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Diabetic foot ulcers portend an almost twofold increase in
  all-cause mortality compared with diabetes on its own. AIM: To investigate the association
  between diabetic foot ulcers and risk of death. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis
  of all observational studies investigating the association between diabetic foot
  ulcers and all-cause mortality. Risk ratios and risk differences were pooled in
  a random-effects model. The I(2) statistic was used to quantify heterogeneity between
  studies. RESULTS: Altogether, we identified 11 studies that reported 84 131 deaths
  from any cause in 446 916 participants with diabetes during a total of 643 499 person-years
  of follow-up. The crude event rate for all-cause mortality in individuals with diabetes
  who did not develop foot ulceration was 22% lower at 181.5 deaths (per 1000 person-years)
  than in those who developed foot ulcers (230.8 per 1000 person-years). Diabetic
  foot ulceration was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (pooled
  relative risk 2.45, 95% CI 1.85-2.85). We did not observe any tangible differences
  in risk of all-cause mortality from diagnosis in studies reporting a mean duration
  of follow-up of ≤3 years (relative risk 2.43, 95% CI 2.27-2.61) or >3 years (relative
  risk 2.26, 95% CI 2.13-2.40) years. Funnel plot inspection revealed no significant
  publication bias among studies included in this meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our
  study shows an excess rate of all-cause mortality in people with diabetic foot ulceration
  when compared to those without foot ulceration. It is imperative that early interventions
  to prevent foot ulceration and modify cardiovascular disease risk factors are put
  in place to reduce excess mortality.'
