abstract: 'BACKGROUND: A feasibility study was conducted to investigate whether an
  occupational at-risk cohort of women in Mwanza, Tanzania are a suitable study population
  for future phase III vaginal microbicide trials. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
  1573 women aged 16-54 y working in traditional and modern bars, restaurants, hotels,
  guesthouses or as local food-handlers were enrolled at community-based reproductive
  health clinics, provided specimens for HIV/STI and pregnancy testing, and asked
  to attend three-monthly clinical follow-up visits for 12-months. HIV positive and
  negative women were eligible to enter the feasibility study and to receive free
  reproductive health services at any time. HIV prevalence at baseline was 26.5% (417/1573).
  HIV incidence among 1156 sero-negative women attending at baseline was 2.9/100PYs.
  Among 1020 HIV sero-negative, non-pregnant women, HIV incidence was 2.0/100PYs,
  HSV-2 incidence 12.7/100PYs and pregnancy rate 17.8/100PYs. Retention at three-months
  was 76.3% (778/1020). Among 771 HIV sero-negative, non-pregnant women attending
  at three-months, subsequent follow-up at 6, 9 and 12-months was 83.7%, 79.6%, and
  72.1% respectively. Older women, those who had not moved home or changed their place
  of work in the last year, and women working in traditional bars or as local food
  handlers had the highest re-attendance. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Women working
  in food outlets and recreational facilities in Tanzania and other parts of Africa
  may be a suitable study population for microbicide and other HIV prevention trials.
  Effective locally-appropriate strategies to address high pregnancy rates and early
  losses to follow-up are essential to minimise risk to clinical trials in these settings.'
