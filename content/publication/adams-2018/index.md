abstract: "BACKGROUND: Several authorities recommend measuring peak expiratory flow\
  \ (PEF) standing. Limited evidence suggests that PEF obtained sitting is similar\
  \ in magnitude but there are no studies in African populations. AIM: To determine\
  \ in adults aged 18-60 years if PEF measured sitting differs from that measured\
  \ standing. DESIGN & SETTING: Crossover design with alternating position of initial\
  \ measurement in people attending primary care clinics in Barbados. METHOD: Quota\
  \ sampling by age, sex, and clinic of adults aged 18-60 years was done and an interviewer-administered\
  \ questionnaire was completed. PEF sitting and standing was measured with an European\
  \ Union (EU) scale Mini-WrightÂ® meter. The highest of three readings in each position\
  \ was used and the difference in means tested for significance using the paired\
  \ sample t-test. RESULTS: Characteristics of the 199 participants were 44% male;\
  \ 96.5% of African descent; mean age 37 years (standard deviation [SD] 12.8); 22%\
  \ with an asthma diagnosis; 23% tobacco users; and 22% marijuana users. Mean PEF\
  \ standing was 438.4 versus 429.7 lmin(-1) sitting, mean difference 8.7 (95% confidence\
  \ interval [CI] = 3.6 to 13.8). For men, mean PEF standing was 518.7 versus 506.3\
  \ lmin(-1) sitting, mean difference 12.4 (95% CI = 3.3 to 21.5). For women, mean\
  \ PEF was 374.7 standing versus 368.9 lmin(-1) sitting, mean difference 5.8 (95%\
  \ CI = 0.11 to 11.5). A Bland-Altman plot accounting for trend and a Lin's correlation\
  \ coefficient of 0.935 demonstrated good agreement between standing and sitting\
  \ PEF. CONCLUSION: PEF measurements are reduced when performed sitting compared\
  \ to standing. The difference is small and unlikely to alter clinical management\
  \ in most cases."
