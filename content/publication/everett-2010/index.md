abstract: This study was designed to investigate the factors associated with the high
  rate of false-positive test results observed with the 4th-generation Murex HIV Ag/Ab
  Combination EIA (enzyme immunoassay) within an adolescent and young-adult cohort
  in northwest Tanzania. (4th-generation assays by definition detect both HIV antigen
  and antibody.) The clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with false-positive
  HIV results were analyzed for 6,940 Tanzanian adolescents and young adults. A subsample
  of 284 Murex assay-negative and 240 false-positive serum samples were analyzed for
  immunological factors, including IgG antibodies to malaria and schistosoma parasites,
  heterophile antibodies, and rheumatoid factor (RF) titers. Conditional logistic
  regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
  False-positive HIV test results were associated with evidence of other infections.
  False positivity was strongly associated with increasing levels of Schistosoma haematobium
  worm IgG1, with adolescents with optical densities in the top quartile being at
  the highest risk (adjusted OR=40.7, 95% CI=8.5 to 194.2 compared with the risk for
  those in the bottom quartile). False positivity was also significantly associated
  with increasing S. mansoni egg IgG1 titers and RF titers of >or=80 (adjusted OR=8.2,
  95% CI=2.8 to 24.3). There was a significant negative association between Murex
  assay false positivity and the levels of S. mansoni worm IgG1 and IgG2 and Plasmodium
  falciparum IgG1 and IgG4. In Africa, endemic infections may affect the specificities
  of immunoassays for HIV infection. Caution should be used when the results of 4th-generation
  HIV test results are interpreted for African adolescent populations.
