abstract: Objective To describe the surveillance model used to develop the first national,
  population-based, multiple noncommunicable disease (NCD) registry in the Caribbean
  (one of the first of its kind worldwide); registry implementation; lessons learned;
  and incidence and mortality rates from the first years of operation. Methods Driven
  by limited national resources, this initiative of the Barbados Ministry of Health
  (MoH), in collaboration with The University of the West Indies, was designed to
  collect prospective data on incident stroke and acute myocardial infarction (MI)
  (heart attack) cases from all health care facilities in this small island developing
  state (SIDS) in the Eastern Caribbean. Emphasis is on tertiary and emergency health
  care data sources. Incident cancer cases are obtained retrospectively, primarily
  from laboratories. Deaths are collected from the national death register. Results
  Phased introduction of the Barbados National Registry for Chronic NCDs (\"the BNR\")
  began with the stroke component (\"BNR-Stroke,\" 2008), followed by the acute MI
  component (\"BNR-Heart,\" 2009) and the cancer component (\"BNR-Cancer,\" 2010).
  Expected case numbers projected from prior studies estimated an average of 378 first-ever
  stroke, 900 stroke, and 372 acute MI patients annually, and registry data showed
  an annual average of about 238, 593, and 349 patients respectively. There were 1
  204 tumors registered in 2008, versus the expected 1 395. Registry data were used
  to identify public health training themes. Success required building support from
  local health care professionals and creating island-wide registry awareness. With
  spending of approximately US$ 148 per event for 2 200 events per year, the program
  costs the MoH about US$ 1 per capita annually. Conclusions Given the limited absolute
  health resources available to SIDS, combined surveillance should be considered for
  building a national NCD evidence base. With prevalence expected to increase further
  worldwide, Barbados' experiences are offered as a \"road map\" for other limited-resource
  countries considering national NCD surveillance.
