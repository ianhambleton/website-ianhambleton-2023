abstract: High blood cholesterol is typically considered a feature of wealthy western
  countries(1,2). However, dietary and behavioural determinants of blood cholesterol
  are changing rapidly throughout the world(3) and countries are using lipid-lowering
  medications at varying rates. These changes can have distinct effects on the levels
  of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol, which have
  different effects on human health(4,5). However, the trends of HDL and non-HDL cholesterol
  levels over time have not been previously reported in a global analysis. Here we
  pooled 1,127 population-based studies that measured blood lipids in 102.6 million
  individuals aged 18 years and older to estimate trends from 1980 to 2018 in mean
  total, non-HDL and HDL cholesterol levels for 200 countries. Globally, there was
  little change in total or non-HDL cholesterol from 1980 to 2018. This was a net
  effect of increases in low- and middle-income countries, especially in east and
  southeast Asia, and decreases in high-income western countries, especially those
  in northwestern Europe, and in central and eastern Europe. As a result, countries
  with the highest level of non-HDL cholesterol-which is a marker of cardiovascular
  risk-changed from those in western Europe such as Belgium, Finland, Greenland, Iceland,
  Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Malta in 1980 to those in Asia and the Pacific,
  such as Tokelau, Malaysia, The Philippines and Thailand. In 2017, high non-HDL cholesterol
  was responsible for an estimated 3.9 million (95% credible interval 3.7 million-4.2 million)
  worldwide deaths, half of which occurred in east, southeast and south Asia. The
  global repositioning of lipid-related risk, with non-optimal cholesterol shifting
  from a distinct feature of high-income countries in northwestern Europe, north America
  and Australasia to one that affects countries in east and southeast Asia and Oceania
  should motivate the use of population-based policies and personal interventions
  to improve nutrition and enhance access to treatment throughout the world.
