abstract: The desire for peri-operative information has been examined in patients
  from other countries. This study was undertaken to assess the peri-operative information
  needs in Jamaican patients and to compare them to those from other populations.
  A questionnaire examining the desire for information about impending anaesthesia
  was administered to 93 patients awaiting elective surgery at the University Hospital
  of the West Indies. Responses were assessed across age and gender, and were compared
  to results from five industrialized countries. Although Jamaican patients expressed
  a desire for information concerning anaesthesia and surgery, they did not regard
  it as their right to get information, and this was the most important factor in
  the Jamaican sample providing a significantly less positive response than patients
  from other nations (p < 0.01 versus each country). Information priority was given
  to practical aspects of anaesthesia and post-operative outcome-mobility, pain, and
  the consumption of food and drink. Meeting the anesthetist was high on the list
  of desires. Female patients were 1.9 (Confidence Interval 1.4, 2.5) times more likely
  to express a positive desire for information. There were no age-related differences.
