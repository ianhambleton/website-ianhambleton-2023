abstract: "BACKGROUND: The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be lower\
  \ among people of African descent than Caucasians. However, incidence studies among\
  \ the former are uncommon and are often limited by incomplete case ascertainment\
  \ or uncertainty about the size of the \\\"at-risk\\\" population. METHODS: We report\
  \ the incidence and prevalence of IBD among people of African ancestry in Barbados\
  \ from island-wide disease surveillance over a 25-year period beginning January\
  \ 1980. RESULTS: The annual incidence of IBD age standardized to the world population\
  \ was 1.85 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53-2.22) for\
  \ ulcerative colitis (UC) and 0.70 per 100,000 person-years (0.51-0.95) for Crohn's\
  \ disease (CD). These incidence rates increased to 2.09 and 0.76 when standardized\
  \ to the US population. The UC incidence rate increased from 1.3 in 1980-1984 to\
  \ 2.3 in 1995-1999, and decreased to 1.6 in 2000-2004. The CD incidence rate followed\
  \ a similar trend, rising from 0.3 in 1980-1984 to 1.3 in 1990-1994 before decreasing\
  \ to 0.6. IBD prevalence in December 2004 was 44.3 per 100,000 person-years (36.7-53.0)\
  \ for UC and 16.7 per 100,000 person-years (12.2-22.4) for CD. In the island-nation\
  \ of Barbados, with a population in 2000 of 270,000, we expect between 4.3 and 6.1\
  \ new cases of UC and between 1.5 and 2.6 new cases of CD each year. CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ The reported rates are generally lower than reported for European and North American\
  \ Caucasians, and are similar to The French West Indies--the only other IBD disease\
  \ register in the Caribbean."
