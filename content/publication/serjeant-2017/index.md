abstract: 'The gene for hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) in the Caribbean
  is much more common than previously estimated. To avoid labeling persons with the
  benign syndrome Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T)/HPFH as a disease and wasting scarce resources,
  parental studies are recommended when newborn screening reveals a pattern consistent
  with an SS phenotype.'
