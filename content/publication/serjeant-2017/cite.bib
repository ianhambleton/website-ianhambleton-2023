 abstract = {The gene for hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) in the Caribbean is much more common than previously estimated. To avoid labeling persons with the benign syndrome Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T)/HPFH as a disease and wasting scarce resources, parental studies are recommended when newborn screening reveals a pattern consistent with an SS phenotype.},
