abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible differences in coping mechanisms in\
  \ the painful crisis between Jamaican and London patients with homozygous sickle\
  \ cell disease. DESIGN: Patients recruited from two London hospitals and the MRC\
  \ Laboratories (Jamaica) at the University of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica\
  \ were assessed using a questionnaire design. Patients with homozygous sickle cell\
  \ disease were included, 30 in London and 30 in Jamaica. RESULTS: Jamaican patients\
  \ in Jamaica had less general anxiety, a lower emotional response to pain, lower\
  \ levels of perceived pain, and felt better able to decrease their pain. London\
  \ patients believed that the disease had a more marked effect on their quality of\
  \ life. CONCLUSION: Understanding the differences between patients' response to\
  \ pain and their coping ability between Jamaican and UK patients may have important\
  \ lessons for evolving effective management in the UK."
