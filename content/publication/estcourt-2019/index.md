abstract: "BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is a genetic haemoglobin disorder, which\
  \ can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications,\
  \ and premature death. Sickle cell disease is one of the most common severe monogenic\
  \ disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta\
  \ globin) genes. The two most common chronic chest complications due to sickle cell\
  \ disease are pulmonary hypertension and chronic sickle lung disease. These complications\
  \ can lead to morbidity (such as reduced exercise tolerance) and increased mortality.\
  \ This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2011 and updated in\
  \ 2014 and 2016. OBJECTIVES: We wanted to determine whether trials involving people\
  \ with sickle cell disease that compare regular long-term blood transfusion regimens\
  \ with standard care, hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) any other drug treatment show\
  \ differences in the following: mortality associated with chronic chest complications;\
  \ severity of established chronic chest complications; development and progression\
  \ of chronic chest complications; serious adverse events. SEARCH METHODS: We searched\
  \ the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies\
  \ Trials Register. Date of the last search: 19 September 2019. We also searched\
  \ for randomised controlled trials in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled\
  \ Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, Issue 10, 14 November 2018), MEDLINE (from\
  \ 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), the Transfusion Evidence Library\
  \ (from 1950), and ongoing trial databases to 14 November 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA:\
  \ We included randomised controlled trials of people of any age with one of four\
  \ common sickle cell disease genotypes, i.e. Hb SS, Sβº, SC, or Sβ(+) that compared\
  \ regular red blood cell transfusion regimens (either simple or exchange transfusions)\
  \ to hydroxycarbamide, any other drug treatment, or to standard care that were aimed\
  \ at reducing the development or progression of chronic chest complications (chronic\
  \ sickle lung and pulmonary hypertension). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used\
  \ the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: No\
  \ studies matching the selection criteria were found. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There\
  \ is a need for randomised controlled trials looking at the role of long-term transfusion\
  \ therapy in pulmonary hypertension and chronic sickle lung disease. Due to the\
  \ chronic nature of the conditions, such trials should aim to use a combination\
  \ of objective and subjective measures to assess participants repeatedly before\
  \ and after the intervention."
