abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Extravascular trafficking of leukocytes into organs is thought
  to play a major role in the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the inflammatory response
  to cardiopulmonary bypass, yet leukocyte extravasation is difficult to study clinically.
  Here we have tested the hypothesis that leukocyte emigration into skin blisters
  can provide a way to monitor the inflammatory effect of cardiopulmonary bypass that
  allows testing of anti-inflammatory interventions (exemplified by aprotinin). METHODS:
  Patients undergoing primary elective coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 14) were
  randomized into 2 equal groups to receive saline infusion during cardiopulmonary
  bypass (control group) or high-dose aprotinin. Experimental skin blisters (in duplicate)
  were induced on the forearm by means of topical application of the vesicant cantharidin,
  and blister fluid was sampled at 5 hours postoperatively. Inflammatory leukocyte
  subsets in blister fluid were analyzed by means of flow cytometry by using expression
  of CD11b and CD62L as a phenotypic marker of activation. RESULTS: In the control
  group of patients, cardiopulmonary bypass surgery triggered a 381% increase in leukocyte
  extravasation into the skin compared with reference blisters carried out before
  surgical intervention, with neutrophil (P = .014), monocyte (P = .014), and eosinophil
  (P = .009) levels all statistically significantly increased. In the aprotinin group
  there was no statistically significant increase during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery
  in any inflammatory leukocyte subset. The activation phenotype of extravascular
  leukocytes was not significantly altered between surgical groups. CONCLUSIONS: This
  study introduces the cantharidin blister technique as a powerful new research tool
  for analyzing the inflammatory effect of cardiopulmonary bypass in vivo. It has
  provided detailed molecular insight into the extravascular leukocyte population
  during cardiopulmonary bypass. Although aprotinin blocked cardiopulmonary bypass-dependent
  extravasation of leukocytes, there was no change in their CD11b/CD62L activation
  status. The cantharidin skin test thus represents a novel research tool for evaluating
  future anti-inflammatory interventions in cardiothoracic surgery.'
