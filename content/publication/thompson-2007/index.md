abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in homozygous sickle cell
  (SS) disease is supranormal in childhood but falls steeply with age, often culminating
  in renal failure. The risk factors underlying these observations are unclear. We
  therefore sought to investigate the relationships between blood pressure, renal
  hemodynamics, and urinary albumin excretion in subjects with SS disease and matched
  controls with a normal AA genotype (hereinafter, controls) as a prelude to intervention
  studies. METHODS: Serum creatinine level, GFR, effective renal plasma flow, blood
  pressure, and urinary albumin and creatinine excretion rates were measured in Jamaican
  individuals with SS disease aged 18 to 23 years and in controls followed from birth
  in a cohort study. RESULTS: Compared with controls, subjects with SS disease showed
  lower blood pressure and normal or supranormal GFR and effective renal plasma flow.
  Urinary albumin excretion exceeded 20 microg/min in 26% of subjects with SS disease
  and correlated positively with GFR and systolic blood pressure and negatively with
  hematocrit. A higher GFR and increased tubular secretion of creatinine combined
  to lower serum creatinine levels in patients with SS disease, giving an upper limit
  of the reference range of 0.90 mg/dL (80 micromol/L) in men and 0.77 mg/dL (68 micromol/L)
  in women. In addition, creatinine clearance measurements were consistently greater
  than GFR in subjects with SS disease. CONCLUSIONS: The GFR remained within reference
  range or elevated in patients with SS disease aged 18 to 23 years. The higher GFR
  in patients with albuminuria was consistent with the hypothesis that high glomerular
  flows cause renal damage. Lower serum creatinine levels characterize patients with
  SS disease, and a revised clinical definition based on serum creatinine level alone
  is proposed.'
