abstract: "BACKGROUND: The world's population is ageing, and four of the top 10 most\
  \ rapidly ageing developing nations are from the region of Latin America and the\
  \ Caribbean (LAC). Although an ageing population heralds likely increases in chronic\
  \ disease, disability-related dependence, and economic burden, the societal contribution\
  \ of the chronically ill or those with disability is not often measured. METHODS:\
  \ We calculated country-specific prevalences of 'disability' (difficulty with at\
  \ least one activity of daily living), 'disease' and 'co-morbidity' (presence of\
  \ at least one, and at least two, of seven chronic diseases/conditions, respectively),\
  \ and 'active community engagement' (using five levels of community participation,\
  \ from less than weekly community contact to voluntary or paid work) in seven LAC\
  \ cities. We estimated remaining life expectancy (LE) with and without disability,\
  \ disease and co-morbidity, and investigated age, sex, and regional variations in\
  \ disability-free LE. Finally, we modeled the association of disease, co-morbidity\
  \ and disability with active community participation using an ordinal regression\
  \ model, adjusted for depression. RESULTS: Overall, 77% of the LAC elderly had at\
  \ least one chronic disease/condition, 44% had co-morbidity and 19% had a disability.\
  \ The proportion of disability-free LE declined between the youngest (60-64 years)\
  \ and the eldest (90 years and over) age-groups for both men (from 85% to 55%) and\
  \ women (from 75% to 45%). Disease-free and co-morbidity-free LE, however, remained\
  \ at approximately 30% and 62%, respectively, for men (20% and 48% for women), until\
  \ 80-84 years of age, then increased. Only Bridgetown's participants had statistically\
  \ significantly longer disability-free LE than the regional average (IRR = 1.08;\
  \ 95%CI 1.05-1.10; p < 0.001). Only Santiago's participants had disability-free\
  \ LE which was shorter than the regional average (IRR = 0.94; 95%CI 0.92-0.97; p\
  \ < 0.001). There was 75% active community participation overall, with more women\
  \ than men involved in active help (49% vs 32%, respectively) and more men involved\
  \ in voluntary/paid work (46% vs 25%, respectively). There was either no, or borderline\
  \ significance in the association between having one or more diseases/conditions\
  \ and active community engagement for both sexes. These associations were limited\
  \ by depression (odds ratio [OR] reduced by 15-17% for men, and by 8-11% for women),\
  \ and only remained statistically significant in men. However, disability remained\
  \ statistically significantly associated with less community engagement after adjusting\
  \ for depression (OR = 0.58, 95%CI 0.49-0.69, p < 0.001 for women and OR = 0.50,\
  \ 95%CI 0.47-0.65, p < 0.001 for men). CONCLUSION: There is an increasing burden\
  \ of disease and disability with older age across the LAC region. As these nations\
  \ cope with resulting social and economic demands, governments and civic societies\
  \ must continue to develop and maintain opportunities for community participation\
  \ by this increasingly frail, but actively engaged group."
