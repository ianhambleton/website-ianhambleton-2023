abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To compare the haematological and clinical features of homozygous
  sickle cell (SS) disease in Bantu and Benin haplotypes in a cross-sectional study
  of 115 Ugandan patients attending the Sickle Cell Clinic at Mulago Hospital, Kampala,
  Uganda, with 311 patients in the Jamaican Cohort Study METHODS: This involved comparison
  of clinical features and haematology with special reference to genetic determinants
  of severity including fetal haemoglobin levels, beta-globin haplotype and alpha
  thalassaemia status. RESULTS: The Bantu haplotype accounted for 94% of HbS chromosomes
  in Ugandan patients and the Benin haplotype for 76% of HbS chromosomes in Jamaica.
  Ugandan patients were marginally more likely to have alpha thalassaemia, had similar
  total haemoglobin and fetal haemoglobin levels but had higher reticulocyte counts
  and total bilirubin levels consistent with greater haemolysis. Ugandan patients
  had less leg ulceration and priapism, but the mode of clinical presentation, prevalence
  of dactylitis, features of bone pain and degree of delay in sexual development,
  assessed by menarche, were similar in the groups. In Ugandan patients, a history
  of anaemic episodes was common but these were poorly documented. CONCLUSION: The
  haematological and clinical features of the Bantu haplotype in Uganda were broadly
  similar to the Benin haplotype in Jamaica except for less leg ulceration and priapism
  and possibly greater haemolysis among Ugandan subjects. Anaemic episodes in Uganda
  were treated empirically by transfusion often without a clear diagnosis; better
  documentation including reticulocyte counts and observations on spleen size is necessary
  to evolve appropriate models of care.'
