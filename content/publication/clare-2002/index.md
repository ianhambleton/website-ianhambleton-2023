abstract: Chronic leg ulceration is a common cause of morbidity in Jamaican patients
  with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease. Ulcers heal more rapidly on bed rest and
  deteriorate on prolonged standing, suggesting a role of venous hypertension in their
  persistence. This hypothesis has been tested by Doppler detection of venous competence
  in SS patients and in matched controls with a normal haemoglobin (AA) genotype in
  the Jamaican Cohort Study. Venous incompetence was significantly more frequent in
  SS disease [137/183 (75%)] than in non-pregnant AA controls [53/137 (39%)]. Past
  or present ulceration occurred in 78 (43%) SS patients, with a highly significant
  association between leg ulceration and venous incompetence in the same leg (P <
  0.001). Prominence and/or varicosities of the veins and spontaneous leg ulcers were
  more common among patients with multiple sites of incompetence. The association
  of venous incompetence with chronic leg ulceration identifies a further pathological
  mechanism contributing to the morbidity of SS disease. The cause of venous incompetence
  is unknown but the sluggish circulation associated with dependency, turbidity and
  impaired linear flow at venous valves, hypoxia-induced sickling, the rheological
  effects of high white cell counts, and activation of components of the coagulation
  system may all contribute. Venous hypertension in SS patients with leg ulceration
  suggests that firm elastic supportive dressings might promote healing of chronic
  leg ulcers.
