abstract: The objective of this study was to determine whether plasmin could induce
  morphological changes in human glial cells via PAR1. Human glioblastoma A172 cells
  were cultured in the presence of plasmin or the PAR1 specific activating hexapeptide,
  SFLLRN. Cells were monitored by flow cytometry to detect proteolytic activation
  of PAR1 receptor. Morphological changes were recorded by photomicroscopy and apoptosis
  was measured by annexinV staining. Plasmin cleaved the PAR1 receptor on glial cells
  at 5 minutes (P = 0.02). After 30 minutes, cellular processes had begun to retract
  from the basal substratum and by 4 hours glial cells had become detached. Similar
  results were obtained by generating plasmin de novo from plasminogen. Morphological
  transformation was blocked by plasmin inhibitors aprotinin or epsilon-aminocaproic
  acid (P = 0.03). Cell viability was unimpaired during early morphological changes,
  but by 24 hours following plasmin treatment 22% of glial cells were apoptotic. PAR1
  activating peptide SFLLRN (but not inactive isomer FSLLRN) promoted analogous glial
  cell detachment (P = 0.03), proving the role for PAR1 in this process. This study
  has identified a plasmin/PAR1 axis of glial cell activation, linked to changes in
  glial cell morophology. This adds to our understanding of pathophysiological disease
  mechanisms of plasmin and the plasminogen system in neuroinjury.
