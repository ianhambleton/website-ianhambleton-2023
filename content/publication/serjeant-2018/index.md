abstract: Globally, the majority of persons born with sickle cell disease do not have
  access to hydroxyurea or more expensive interventions. The objectives were to estimate
  the survival in homozygous sickle cell disease, unbiased by symptomatic selection
  and to ascertain the causes of death in a pre-hydroxyurea population. The utility
  of early life biomarkers and genetically determined phenotypes to predict survival
  was assessed. A cohort study based on neonatal diagnosis was undertaken at the Sickle
  Cell Unit, a specialist clinic delivering care to persons with sickle cell disease
  in Jamaica. Screening of 100,000 deliveries detected 315 babies with homozygous
  sickle cell disease of whom 311 have been followed from birth for periods up to
  43 years. Pneumococcal prophylaxis and teaching mothers splenic palpation were important,
  inexpensive interventions. Anticipatory guidance, routine care and out-patient acute
  care were provided. Each participant was classified as alive, dead, or defaulted
  (usually emigration). Causes of death were ascertained from clinical records and/or
  post-mortem reports. Survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier function. Sex-adjusted
  Cox semi-parametric proportional hazards and Weibull modelling were used to assess
  the effects on survival of biomarkers. Survival to 40 years was 55.5% (95% CI 48.7%
  to 61.7%). Acute Chest Syndrome (n = 31) and septicemia (n = 14) were significant
  causes of death at all ages. Acute splenic sequestration (n = 12) was the most common
  cause of early deaths. Survival was significantly shorter in those with lower hemoglobin
  at 1 year, high total nucleated count at 1 year, and a history of dactylitis ever.
  In these hydroxyurea na√Øve patients, survival into midlife was common. Causes of
  death were often age specific and some may be preventable. Early life biomarkers
  predictive of decreased survival in SS disease identify a patient group likely to
  benefit from close clinical supervision and potentially high risk therapies.
