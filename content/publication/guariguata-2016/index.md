abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Diabetes is highly prevalent in the Caribbean, associated with
  a high morbidity and mortality and is a recognised threat to economic and social
  development. Heads of Government in the Caribbean Community came together in 2007
  and declared their commitment to reducing the burden of non-communicable diseases
  (NCDs), including diabetes, by calling for a multi-sectoral, systemic response.
  To facilitate the development of effective policies, policymakers are being engaged
  in the development and use of a system dynamics (SD) model of diabetes for Caribbean
  countries. METHODS: Previous work on a diabetes SD model from the United States
  of America (USA) is being adapted to a local context for three countries in the
  region using input from stakeholders, a review of existing qualitative and quantitative
  data, and collection of new qualitative data. Three country models will be developed
  using one-on-one stakeholder engagement and iterative revision. An inter-country
  model will also be developed following a model-building workshop. Models will be
  compared to each other and to the USA model. The inter-country model will be used
  to simulate policies identified as priorities by stakeholders and to develop targets
  for prevention and control. The model and model-building process will be evaluated
  by stakeholders and a manual developed for use in other high-burden developing regions.
  DISCUSSION: SD has been applied with success for health policy development in high-income
  country settings. The utility of SD in developing countries as an aid to policy
  decision-making related to NCDs has not been tested. This study represents the first
  of its kind.'
