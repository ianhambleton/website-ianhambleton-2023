abstract: "BACKGROUND: Data on disparities in mortality within low and middle income\
  \ countries are limited, with little published data from the Caribbean or Central\
  \ America. Our aim was to investigate disparities in overall and cause specific\
  \ premature adult mortality in the multi-ethnic middle income country of Belize.\
  \ METHODS: Mortality data from Belize 2008-2010 classified using the International\
  \ Classification of Diseases 10 and the 2010 census stratified by age and ethnicity\
  \ were used to calculate age, sex, and ethnic specific mortality rates for those\
  \ 15-59 years, and life table analysis was used to estimate the probability of death\
  \ between the ages of 15 and 59 (45q15). RESULTS: The probability of death among\
  \ those aged 15 to 59 years was 18.1% (women 13.5%, men 22.7%). Creole and Garifuna\
  \ ethnic groups have three times the 45q15 probability of death compared to Mayan\
  \ and Mestizo groups (Creole 31.2%, Garifuna 31.1%, Mayan 10.2%, Mestizo 12.0%).\
  \ This pattern of ethnic disparity existed in both sexes but was greater in men.\
  \ The probability of death from injuries was 14.8% among Creole men, more than twice\
  \ the rate of other ethnicities and peaks among young Creole men. These deaths are\
  \ dominated by homicides and unspecified deaths involving firearms. CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ Marked disparities in mortality between ethnic groups exist in this Central American/Caribbean\
  \ country, from rates that are typical of high-income countries to those of low-income\
  \ countries. The pattern of these extreme differences likely suggests that they\
  \ reflect underlying social determinants rooted in the country's colonial past."
