abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Describing the prevalence and trends of cardiometabolic risk
  factors that are associated with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is crucial for
  monitoring progress, planning prevention, and providing evidence to support policy
  efforts. We aimed to analyse the transition in body-mass index (BMI), obesity, blood
  pressure, raised blood pressure, and diabetes in the Americas, between 1980 and
  2014. METHODS: We did a pooled analysis of population-based studies with data on
  anthropometric measurements, biomarkers for diabetes, and blood pressure from adults
  aged 18 years or older. A Bayesian model was used to estimate trends in BMI, raised
  blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90
  mm Hg), and diabetes (fasting plasma glucose ≥7·0 mmol/L, history of diabetes, or
  diabetes treatment) from 1980 to 2014, in 37 countries and six subregions of the
  Americas. FINDINGS: 389 population-based surveys from the Americas were available.
  Comparing prevalence estimates from 2014 with those of 1980, in the non-English
  speaking Caribbean subregion, the prevalence of obesity increased from 3·9% (95%
  CI 2·2-6·3) in 1980, to 18·6% (14·3-23·3) in 2014, in men; and from 12·2% (8·2-17·0)
  in 1980, to 30·5% (25·7-35·5) in 2014, in women. The English-speaking Caribbean
  subregion had the largest increase in the prevalence of diabetes, from 5·2% (2·1-10·4)
  in men and 6·4% (2·6-10·4) in women in 1980, to 11·1% (6·4-17·3) in men and 13·6%
  (8·2-21·0) in women in 2014). Conversely, the prevalence of raised blood pressure
  has decreased in all subregions; the largest decrease was found in North America
  from 27·6% (22·3-33·2) in men and 19·9% (15·8-24·4) in women in 1980, to 15·5% (11·1-20·9)
  in men and 10·7% (7·7-14·5) in women in 2014. INTERPRETATION: Despite the generally
  high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors across the Americas, estimates also
  showed a high level of heterogeneity in the transition between countries. The increasing
  prevalence of obesity and diabetes observed over time requires appropriate measures
  to deal with these public health challenges. Our results support a diversification
  of health interventions across subregions and countries. FUNDING: Wellcome Trust.'
