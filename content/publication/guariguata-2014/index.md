abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Diabetes is a serious and increasing global health burden
  and estimates of prevalence are essential for appropriate allocation of resources
  and monitoring of trends. METHODS: We conducted a literature search of studies reporting
  the age-specific prevalence for diabetes and used the Analytic Hierarchy Process
  to systematically select studies to generate estimates for 219 countries and territories.
  Estimates for countries without available source data were modelled from pooled
  estimates of countries that were similar in regard to geography, ethnicity, and
  economic development. Logistic regression was applied to generate smoothed age-specific
  prevalence estimates for adults 20-79 years which were then applied to population
  estimates for 2013 and 2035. RESULTS: A total of 744 data sources were considered
  and 174 included, representing 130 countries. In 2013, 382 million people had diabetes;
  this number is expected to rise to 592 million by 2035. Most people with diabetes
  live in low- and middle-income countries and these will experience the greatest
  increase in cases of diabetes over the next 22 years. CONCLUSION: The new estimates
  of diabetes in adults confirm the large burden of diabetes, especially in developing
  countries. Estimates will be updated annually including the most recent, high-quality
  data available.'
