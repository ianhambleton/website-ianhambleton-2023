abstract: "BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is a genetic haemoglobin disorder, which\
  \ can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications,\
  \ and premature death. Sickle cell disease is one of the most common severe monogenic\
  \ disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta\
  \ globin) genes. The two most common chronic chest complications due to sickle cell\
  \ disease are pulmonary hypertension and chronic sickle lung disease. These complications\
  \ can lead to morbidity (such as reduced exercise tolerance) and increased mortality.This\
  \ is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2011 and updated in 2014.\
  \ OBJECTIVES: We wanted to determine whether trials involving people with sickle\
  \ cell disease that compare regular long-term blood transfusion regimens with standard\
  \ care, hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) any other drug treatment show differences\
  \ in the following: mortality associated with chronic chest complications; severity\
  \ of established chronic chest complications; development and progression of chronic\
  \ chest complications; serious adverse events. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane\
  \ Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register.\
  \ Date of the last search: 25 April 2016.We also searched for randomised controlled\
  \ trials in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane\
  \ Library, Issue 1, 26 January 2016), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL\
  \ (from 1937), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950), and ongoing trial databases\
  \ to 26 January 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials\
  \ of people of any age with one of four common sickle cell disease genotypes, i.e.\
  \ Hb SS, Sß(0), SC, or Sß(+) that compared regular red blood cell transfusion regimens\
  \ (either simple or exchange transfusions) to hydroxycarbamide, any other drug treatment,\
  \ or to standard care that were aimed at reducing the development or progression\
  \ of chronic chest complications (chronic sickle lung and pulmonary hypertension).\
  \ DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected\
  \ by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: No studies matching the selection criteria were found.\
  \ AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for randomised controlled trials looking\
  \ at the role of long-term transfusion therapy in pulmonary hypertension and chronic\
  \ sickle lung disease. Due to the chronic nature of the conditions, such trials\
  \ should aim to use a combination of objective and subjective measures to assess\
  \ participants repeatedly before and after the intervention."
