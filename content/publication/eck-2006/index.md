abstract: An understanding of the epidemiological trend in hospital admissions, including
  morbidity and mortality patterns and the economic impact, is critical for healthcare
  planning and appropriate resource allocation. Data were collected on all admissions
  to the paediatric unit of the University Hospital of the West Indies during the
  period 1999. Each observation included demographic data, admission and discharge
  data and billed cost of care. There were 1350 admissions (570 female and 715 male,
  p < 0.001). Admissions \"lows\" were observed in February, April and July; minor
  peaks in March and June and the major peaks between October and January coincided
  with admissions due primarily to respiratory conditions. The evening shift was generally
  the busiest, with the night shift having the lowest average number of admissions
  in any one-week period Occupancy was uniformly high between November and April,
  with minor lows in May and August/September. The total cost for a typical patient
  was J$9708 per admission and the total daily cost for a typical patient was J$1823
  (US$1 = J$39 in 1999). The findings could assist with resource allocation and rationalization
  of health services.
