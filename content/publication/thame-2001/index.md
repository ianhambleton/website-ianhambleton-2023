abstract: 'BACKGROUND: RBC transfusion is widely advocated in the management of sickle
  cell anemia (SCA), but it carries potentially serious risks, especially in the setting
  of chronic transfusion. The Jamaican Sickle Cell Clinic is conservative in its use
  of transfusion, and this experience is presented to allow comparison with other
  centers in defining the role for transfusion in SCA. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Reported
  here is a retrospective, descriptive study of all RBC transfusions given to 311
  subjects with SCA who were followed in a cohort study from birth and are, at this
  writing, 16.3 to 24.7 years old. RESULTS: There were 520 transfusion episodes in
  197 (63.3%) of the 311 subjects; 1 transfusion in 80 (41%) of those who received
  transfusion(s), 2 transfusions in 54 (27%), 3 transfusions in 21 (11%), 4 in 17
  (9%), 5 in 9 (5%), and 6 or more in 16 (8%). Single transfusions were usual for
  acute anemia of aplastic crises or acute splenic sequestration, and multiple transfusions
  (up to 21 episodes) were usual in the prophylaxis of recurrent stroke. Indications
  were aplastic crisis (102), acute chest syndrome (90), acute splenic sequestration
  (75), stroke (62), septicemia (46), hypoplasia (40), hypersplenism (34), surgery
  (31), gastroenteritis (10), and miscellaneous (30). CONCLUSION: Despite conservative
  transfusion use, 70.6 percent of patients had received at least one transfusion
  by 20 years of age in the Jamaican Sickle Cell Clinic:'
