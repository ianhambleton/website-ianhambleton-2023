abstract: In this study, we evaluated the burden and quality of adult inpatient diabetes
  care in Barbados. Inpatients were reviewed over 2 days to identify those with diabetes.
  Data were collected and analysed from identified patients, their notes and management
  charts using an audit methodology developed in the UK. Inpatient diabetes prevelance
  was found to be 42.5% (111 of 261 beds audited). Insulin-treated type 2 diabetes
  affected 41.8% of the patients. Diabetic foot disease accounted for 30% of admissions
  and 89% of diabetes-related admissions. Of the patients admitted without diabetic
  foot disease, 13.9% had their feet examined and 2.8% developed foot lesions during
  their stay. Medication errors were experienced by 41.4% of patients. We recorded
  the prevalence of inpatient diabetes in the English medical literature (42.5%) and
  this was significantly driven by diabetic foot disease. Care needs were complex
  and areas of potential improvement were identified.
