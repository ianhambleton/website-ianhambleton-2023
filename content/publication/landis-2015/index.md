abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Since 2009, seven countries in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
  States (OECS), Antigua & Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Kitts & Nevis,
  Saint Lucia, and St. Vincent & the Grenadines, have been utilizing a laboratory
  referral service for HIV-1 viral load (VL) offered by The Ladymeade Reference Unit
  (LRU) Laboratory, Barbados. The objective of this study was to evaluate 5 year VL
  trends in the six larger OECS countries participating in this regional referral
  service. METHODS: Blood samples were collected in source countries and transported
  to Barbados as frozen plasma according to a standardized protocol. Plasma specimens
  were amplified by RT PCR on a Roche TaqMan 48 analyser (Roche Diagnostics, Panama
  City, Panama). VL was considered optimally suppressed below a threshold level of
  < 200 HIV-1 copies/mL of blood. The same threshold was used as a binary indicator
  in an analysis of the secular change in VL suppression. Montserrat was excluded
  due to insufficient number of samples. RESULTS: A steady rise in VL referrals from
  OECS countries was recorded, rising from 312 samples in 2009 to 1,060 samples in
  2013. A total of 3,543 samples were tested, with a sample rejection rate (9.2%)
  mostly due to breaks in the cold chain. Aggregate VL data showed the odds of VL
  suppression in the Eastern Caribbean improved by 66% for each additional year after
  2009 (Odds Ratio 1.66 [95% CI 1.46 to 1.88]; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate
  the feasibility of establishing a regional laboratory referral service for HIV VL
  monitoring in the Eastern Caribbean. Aggregate VL trends showed a significant year-on-year
  improvement in VL suppression, implying public health benefits through treatment
  as prevention in the OECS. VL provides a powerful monitoring & evaluation tool for
  strengthening HIV programs at country level among the small island states participating
  in this regional referral network.'
