abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To compare coital diaries and face-to-face interviews (FFIs)
  in measuring sexual behaviour among women at high risk of HIV. To assess the effect
  of differing levels of support from researchers on reporting in coital diaries and
  FFIs. METHODS: Three groups of 50 women were randomly selected from a cohort of
  food and recreational facility workers participating in a microbicide trial feasibility
  study and received differing levels of researcher support. Minimum support involved
  delivering and collecting coital diaries weekly; medium support included a weekly
  FFI and discussion of concerns; intensive support also included an unscheduled mid-week
  visit when diaries were checked and concerns addressed. All respondents participated
  in an exit FFI, including questions on sexual behaviour over the four-week study
  period and study acceptability. RESULTS: Sexual behaviours were generally reported
  more frequently in coital diaries than weekly or exit interviews. Vaginal and anal
  sex, male and female condom use, vaginal cleaning and lubrication, sex during menstruation
  and sex with irregular and regular partners were reported more frequently in coital
  diaries than exit interviews. In coital diaries, level of support was associated
  with reporting of vaginal sex and cleaning. In exit interviews, support level was
  associated with reporting of vaginal sex, vaginal cleaning and sex with regular,
  irregular and commercial partners. Women with minimum support reported least satisfaction
  with the research process. Women with intensive support were most likely to report
  that they informed someone about their study participation and that they completed
  diaries daily. CONCLUSION: Compared with FFIs, coital diaries resulted in higher
  reporting of socially stigmatised activities, and sexual behaviour reporting varied
  less by level of support. More researcher support enhanced study acceptability.'
