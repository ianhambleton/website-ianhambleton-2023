abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: This article reports the prevalence of two types of interpersonal
  violence (IPV) (sexual and physical) and one type of aggression (psychological)
  in three low-to-middle-income Caribbean countries. It examines IPV among adolescents
  and young adults as both victims and perpetrators. METHOD: This population-based
  study compares the experiences of 15-30 year olds in countries at different levels
  of socioeconomic development. The Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2) and other
  behavioral instruments were used to assess the level and characteristics of IPV.
  RESULTS: Out of 3 401 respondents, 70.9% reported victimization by some form of
  violence, which was most commonly perpetrated by a relationship partner (62.8%).
  Sexual violence victimization was reported more commonly by women, and was highest
  in Jamaica. Significant between-country differences in overall levels of reported
  physical violence, and psychological aggression, were evident when stratifying by
  perpetrator type. CONCLUSIONS: The very high levels of reported IPV indicate very
  high levels of tolerance among victims, and suggest a culture of violence and of
  adversarial intimate relationships may be well entrenched. The findings support
  the view that co-occurrence of general interpersonal violence and partner violence
  may be limited, and that one may not necessarily be a predictor of the other. They
  also reveal that, among partners, not only are there no gender differentials in
  victimization by physical violence, but more women than men are self-reporting as
  perpetrators of this type of IPV.'
