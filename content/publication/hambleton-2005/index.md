abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To understand the relative contribution of past events and of
  current experiences as determinants of health status among the elderly in the Caribbean
  nation of Barbados, in order to help develop timely public health interventions
  for that population. METHODS: The information for this prevalence study was collected
  in Barbados between December 1999 and June 2000 as part of the \"SABE project,\"
  a multicenter survey in seven urban areas of Latin America and the Caribbean that
  evaluated determinants of health and well-being in elderly populations (persons
  60 and older). We used ordinal logistic regression to model determinants of self-reported
  health status, and we assessed the relative contribution of historical socioeconomic
  indicators and of three current modifiable predictor groups (current socioeconomic
  indicators, lifestyle risk factors, and disease indicators), using simple measures
  of association and model fit. RESULTS: Historical determinants of health status
  accounted for 5.2% of the variation in reported health status, and this was reduced
  to 2.0% when mediating current experiences were considered. Current socioeconomic
  indicators accounted for 4.1% of the variation in reported health status, lifestyle
  risk factors for 7.1%, and current disease indicators for 33.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Past
  socioeconomic experience influenced self-reported health status in elderly Barbadians.
  Over half of this influence from past events was mediated through current socioeconomic,
  lifestyle, and disease experiences. Caring for the sick and reducing lifestyle risk
  factors should be important considerations in the support of the current elderly.
  In addition, ongoing programs for poverty reduction and increased access to health
  care and education should be considered as long-term strategies to improve the health
  of the future elderly.'
