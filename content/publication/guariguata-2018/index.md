abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To conduct an analysis of the most recent data on diabetes
  and its risk factors by gender and other social determinants of health to understand
  why its prevalence is higher among women than men in the Caribbean; to inform policy
  agenda-setting for diabetes prevention and control in the Caribbean; and to identify
  gaps in the evidence that require further research. METHODS: A previous systematic
  review of the literature describing studies conducted in the Caribbean that presented
  the distribution of diabetes, its outcomes, and risk factors, by one or more social
  determinants, was updated to include sources from 1 January 2007 - 31 December 2016.
  Surveys by the World Health Organization (WHO) were also included. Where data were
  sufficient, meta-analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: A total of 8 326 manuscripts
  were identified. Of those, 282 were selected for full text review, and 114, for
  abstraction. In all, 36 papers, including WHO-related surveys, had sufficient information
  for meta-analysis. More women compared to men were obese (OR: 2.1; 95%CI = 1.65
  - 2.69), physically inactive (OR: 2.18; 95%CI = 1.75 - 2.72), and had diabetes (OR:
  1.48; 95%CI = 1.25 - 1.76). More men smoked (OR: 4.27; 95%CI = 3.18 - 5.74) and
  had inadequate fruit and vegetable intake (OR: 1.37; 95%CI = 1.21 - 1.57). CONCLUSION:
  Thirty-six papers were added to the previously conducted systematic review; of those,
  13 were added to the meta-analysis. Diabetes and its risk factors (primarily obesity
  and physical inactivity) continue to disproportionately affect women in the Caribbean.
  Smoking interventions should be targeted at men in this geographic area.'
