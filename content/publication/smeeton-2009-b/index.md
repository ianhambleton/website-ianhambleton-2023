abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Risk of stroke is higher in black Caribbeans in
  the United Kingdom compared with black Caribbeans in their country of origin. We
  investigated if these differences were caused by variations in prior-to-stroke risk
  factors. SUMMARY OF REPORT: Data were collected from the South London Stroke Register
  (SLSR) and the Barbados Register of Strokes (BROS). Differences in prevalence and
  management of stroke risk factors were adjusted for age, sex, living conditions
  prestroke, stroke subtype, and socioeconomic status by multivariable logistic regression.
  Patients in BROS were on average older (mean difference 4 years) and more likely
  to have a nonmanual occupation. They were less likely to have a prestroke diagnosis
  of myocardial infarction (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.77) or diabetes (OR, 0.65;
  95% CI, 0.46 to 0.92) and were less likely to report smoking (OR, 0.31; 95% CI,
  0.19 to 0.49). They were also more likely to receive appropriate prestroke antihypertensive
  (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.92) and antidiabetic treatment (OR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.44
  to 7.70) and less likely to receive cholesterol-lowering drugs (OR, 0.19; 95% CI,
  0.05 to 0.71). CONCLUSIONS: The higher risk of stroke in black Caribbeans in the
  United Kingdom might be caused by a higher prevalence of major prior-to-stroke risk
  factors, differences in treatment patterns for comorbid conditions, and less healthy
  lifestyle practices compared with indigenous black Caribbean populations.'
