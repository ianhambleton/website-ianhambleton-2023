abstract: "OBJECTIVE: We describe trends in life expectancy at birth (LE) and between-country\
  \ LE disparities since 1965, in Latin America and the Caribbean. METHODS & FINDINGS:\
  \ LE trends since 1965 are described for three geographical sub-regions: the Caribbean,\
  \ Central America, and South America. LE disparities are explored using a suite\
  \ of absolute and relative disparity metrics, with measurement consensus providing\
  \ confidence to observed differences. LE has increased throughout Latin America\
  \ and the Caribbean. Compared to the Caribbean, LE has increased by an additional\
  \ 6.6 years in Central America and 4.1 years in South America. Since 1965, average\
  \ reductions in between-country LE disparities were 14% (absolute disparity) and\
  \ 23% (relative disparity) in the Caribbean, 55% and 51% in Central America, 55%\
  \ and 52% in South America. CONCLUSIONS: LE in Latin America and the Caribbean is\
  \ exceeding 'minimum standard' international targets, and is improving relative\
  \ to the world region with the highest human longevity. The Caribbean, which had\
  \ the highest LE and the lowest between-country LE disparities in Latin America\
  \ and the Caribbean in 1965-70, had the lowest LE and the highest LE disparities\
  \ by 2005-10. Caribbean Governments have championed a collaborative solution to\
  \ the growing burden of non-communicable disease, with 15 territories signing on\
  \ to the Declaration of Port of Spain, signalling regional commitment to a coordinated\
  \ public-health response. The persistent LE inequity between Caribbean countries\
  \ suggests that public health interventions should be tailored to individual countries\
  \ to be most effective. Between- and within-country disparity monitoring for a range\
  \ of health metrics should be a priority, first to guide country-level policy initiatives,\
  \ then to contribute to the assessment of policy success."
