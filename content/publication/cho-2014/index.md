abstract: "BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease can cause severe vaso-occlusive crises\
  \ and dysfunction of most organ systems. The two most common chronic chest complications\
  \ due to sickle cell disease are pulmonary hypertension and chronic sickle lung\
  \ disease. These complications can lead to morbidity (such as reduced exercise tolerance)\
  \ and increased mortality. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to find out whether\
  \ trials involving people with sickle cell disease that compare regular long-term\
  \ blood transfusion regimens with an alternative treatment or no treatment show\
  \ differences in the following:1. the incidence of chronic chest complications (chronic\
  \ sickle lung disease or pulmonary hypertension);2. the 'severity' or progression\
  \ of established chronic chest complications;3. the mortality associated with chronic\
  \ chest complications; and4. unacceptable adverse events. SEARCH METHODS: We searched\
  \ the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. Specific websites were also searched\
  \ for information of ongoing or newly completed trials. The search included the\
  \ reference lists of any randomised controlled trials identified using the above\
  \ methods.Date of the most recent search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic\
  \ Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 22 July 2013. SELECTION\
  \ CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials. Trials that used quasi-randomized\
  \ methods were to be included if sufficient evidence existed that the treatment\
  \ and control groups were similar at baseline. Trials were eligible for inclusion\
  \ if they investigated regular red blood cell transfusion regimens (either simple\
  \ top-up or exchange transfusions) aimed at reducing the incidence, mortality, or\
  \ objective measures of severity or progression of chronic chest complications (chronic\
  \ sickle lung and pulmonary hypertension) among men or women of any age and with\
  \ one of four common sickle cell disease genotypes, ie Hb SS, Sß(0), SC, or Sß(+).\
  \ These interventions would be compared to an alternative treatment with the same\
  \ aim or to no treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No studies matching the\
  \ selection criteria were found. MAIN RESULTS: No studies matching the selection\
  \ criteria were found. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for randomized controlled\
  \ trials looking at the role of long-term transfusion therapy in pulmonary hypertension\
  \ and chronic sickle lung disease. Due to the chronic nature of the conditions,\
  \ such trials should aim to use a combination of objective and subjective measures\
  \ to assess participants during an extended 'steady state' baseline, and after the\
  \ intervention."
