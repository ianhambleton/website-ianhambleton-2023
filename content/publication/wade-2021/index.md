abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) cut-offs
  associated with hyperglycemia may differ by ethnicity. We investigated the optimal
  BMI and WC cut-offs for identifying hyperglycemia in the predominantly Afro-Caribbean
  population of Barbados. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study of
  865 individuals aged ≥25 years without known diabetes or cardiovascular disease
  was conducted. Hyperglycemia was defined as fasting plasma glucose ≥5.6 mmol/L or
  hemoglobin A(1c) ≥5.7% (39 mmol/mol). The Youden index was used to identify the
  optimal cut-offs from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Further
  ROC analysis and multivariable log binomial regression were used to compare standard
  and data-derived cut-offs. RESULTS: The prevalence of hyperglycemia was 58.9% (95%
  CI 54.7% to 63.0%). In women, optimal BMI and WC cut-offs (27 kg/m(2) and 87 cm,
  respectively) performed similarly to standard cut-offs. In men, sensitivities of
  the optimal cut-offs of BMI ≥24 kg/m(2) (72.0%) and WC ≥86 cm (74.0%) were higher
  than those for standard BMI and WC obesity cut-offs (30.0% and 25%-46%, respectively),
  although with lower specificity. Hyperglycemia was 70% higher in men above the data-derived
  WC cut-off (prevalence ratio 95% CI 1.2 to 2.3). CONCLUSIONS: While BMI and WC cut-offs
  in Afro-Caribbean women approximate international standards, our findings, consistent
  with other studies, suggest lowering cut-offs in men may be warranted to improve
  detection of hyperglycemia. Our findings do, however, require replication in a new
  data set.'
