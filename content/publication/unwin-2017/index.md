abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Both fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c are recommended
  for the diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes by the American Diabetes Association
  (ADA), and for diabetes by the World Health Organization. The ADA guidance is influential
  on clinical practice in many developing countries, including in the Caribbean and
  Latin America. We aimed to compare the prevalence and characteristics of individuals
  identified as having diabetes and prediabetes by FPG and HbA1c in a predominantly
  African ancestry Caribbean population. METHODS: A representative population-based
  sample of 1234 adults (≥25 years of age) resident in Barbados was recruited. Standard
  methods with appropriate quality control were used to collect data on height, weight,
  blood pressure, fasting lipids and history of diagnosed diabetes, and to measure
  fasting glucose and HbA1c. Those with previously diagnosed diabetes (n = 192) were
  excluded from the analyses. Diabetes was defined as: FPG ≥7.0 mmol/L or HbA1c ≥6.5%;
  prediabetes as: FPG ≥5.6 to <7mmol/L or HbA1c ≥5.7 to <6.5%. RESULTS: Complete data
  were available on 939 participants without previously diagnosed diabetes. The prevalence
  of undiagnosed diabetes was higher, but not significantly so, by HbA1c (4.9%, 95%
  CI 3.5, 6.8) vs FPG (3.5%, 2.4, 5.1). Overall 79 individuals had diabetes by either
  measure, but only 21 on both. The prevalence of prediabetes was higher by HbA1c
  compared to FPG: 41.7% (37.9, 45.6) vs 15.0% (12.8, 17.5). Overall 558 individuals
  had prediabetes by either measure, but only 107 on both. HbA1c, but not FPG, was
  significantly higher in women than men; and FPG, but not HbA1c, was significantly
  associated with raised triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol. CONCLUSION: The agreement
  between FPG and HbA1c defined hyperglycaemia is poor. In addition, there are some
  differences in the phenotype of those identified, and HbA1c gives a much higher
  prevalence of prediabetes. The routine use of HbA1c for screening and diagnosis
  in this population would have major implications for clinical and public health
  policies and resources. Given the lack of robust evidence, particularly for prediabetes,
  on whether intervention in the individuals identified would improve outcomes, this
  approach to screening and diagnosis cannot be currently recommended for this population.'
