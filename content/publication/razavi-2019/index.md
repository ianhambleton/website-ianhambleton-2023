abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To examine the historical trends of premature death due to cardiovascular
  disease and diabetes mellitus (CVD-DM) in the Caribbean and to identify any associations
  between these trends and health care expenditure. METHODS: Death data were obtained
  from the World Health Organization Mortality Database; population data, from the
  United Nations World Population prospects; and health care expenditure data, from
  the World Bank. In all, 17 Caribbean countries had mortality data; however, only
  11 had both mortality and health care expenditure data available. The analyses explored
  country-level trends in age-standardized CVD-DM mortality rates using 3-year moving
  averages from 1995 - 2014 for women and men. Associations between secular mortality
  rate change and health care expenditure were considered. RESULTS: CVD-DM mortality
  rates ranged from 10.7 - 247.1 per 100 000, with a mean of 92.3 and standard deviation
  of 47.6. Of the 17 countries, 12 showed a reduction in premature CVD-DM mortality
  in both men and women, with others either showing no improvement or increases. Mortality
  rates for men were 1.46 times higher than for women. On average, there was a 68%
  increase in health care expenditure, with a 15.4% fall in CVD-DM mortality in women
  and 4.9% in men. Mixed effects modelling demonstrated a weak association between
  health care expenditure and declining CVD-DM mortality for both women -0.006 (95%CI
  = -0.014 - 0.001) and men -0.008 (95%CI = -0.017 - 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Findings
  suggest that progress has been made to reduce premature CVD-DM related mortality
  in a number of Caribbean countries. Differences between countries may be partly
  related to differences in health care system performance, although further research
  that considers confounders is needed.'
