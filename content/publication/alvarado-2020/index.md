abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes have been implemented widely.
  We aimed to use a pre-existing nutritional survey data to inform SSB tax design
  by assessing: (1) baseline consumption of SSBs and SSB-derived free sugars, (2)
  the percentage of SSB-derived free sugars that would be covered by a tax and (3)
  the extent to which a tax would differentiate between high-sugar SSBs and low-sugar
  SSBs. We evaluated these three considerations using pre-existing nutritional survey
  data in a developing economy setting. METHODS: We used data from a nationally representative
  cross-sectional survey in Barbados (2012-2013, prior to SSB tax implementation).
  Data were available on 334 adults (25-64 years) who completed two non-consecutive
  24-hour dietary recalls. We estimated the prevalence of SSB consumption and its
  contribution to total energy intake, overall and stratified by taxable status. We
  assessed the percentage of SSB-derived free sugars subject to the tax and identified
  the consumption-weighted sugar concentration of SSBs, stratified by taxable status.
  FINDINGS: Accounting for sampling probability, 88.8% of adults (95% CI 85.1 to 92.5)
  reported SSB consumption, with a geometric mean of 2.4 servings/day (±2 SD, 0.6,
  9.2) among SSB consumers. Sixty percent (95% CI 54.6 to 65.4) of SSB-derived free
  sugars would be subject to the tax. The tax did not clearly differentiate between
  high-sugar beverages and low-sugar beverages. CONCLUSION: Given high SSB consumption,
  targeting SSBs was a sensible strategy in this setting. A substantial percentage
  of free sugars from SSBs were not covered by the tax, reducing possible health benefits.
  The considerations proposed here may help policymakers to design more effective
  SSB taxes.'
