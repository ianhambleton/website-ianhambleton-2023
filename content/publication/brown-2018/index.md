abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths
  among Caribbean men. However, little data exists on the influence of social factors
  on prostate cancer in the Caribbean setting. This article supports the 2011 Rio
  Political Declaration on addressing health inequalities by presenting a systematic
  review of evidence on the role of social determinants on prostate cancer in Caribbean
  men. It aims to determine the distribution, by known social determinants of health,
  of the frequency and adverse outcomes of prostate cancer among Caribbean populations.
  METHODS: Observational studies reporting an association between a social determinant
  and prostate cancer frequency and outcomes were sought in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciELO,
  CINAHL, CUMED, LILACS, and IBECS databases. Fourteen social determinants and 7 prostate
  cancer endpoints were chosen, providing 98 possible relationship groups exploring
  the role of social determinants on prostate cancer. Observational studies with > 50
  participants conducted in Caribbean territories between 2004 and 2016 were eligible.
  The review was conducted according to STROBE and PRISMA guidelines. Random-effects
  meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: From 843 potentially relevant citations,
  13 articles from 9 studies were included. From these included studies, 24 relationships
  were reported looking at 11 distinct relationship groups, leaving 90 relationship
  groups (92% of all relationship groups) unexplored. Study heterogeneity and risk
  of bias restricted results to a narrative synthesis in most instances. Meta-analyses
  showed more diagnosed prostate cancer among men with less formal education (n = 2
  studies, OR 1.60, 95%CI 1.18-2.19) and among men who were married (n = 3 studies,
  OR 1.54, 95%CI 1.22-1.95). CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights limited evidence
  for a higher occurrence of diagnosed prostate cancer among Caribbean men with lower
  levels of education and among men who are married. The role of social determinants
  on prostate cancer among Caribbean men remains poorly understood. Improvements in
  study quantity and quality, and reduced variability in outcomes and reporting are
  needed. This report represents the current evidence, and provides a roadmap to future
  research priorities for a better understanding of Caribbean prostate cancer inequalities.'
