abstract: 'BACKGROUND: We describe hospital-based management of acute ischaemic stroke
  patients in 2010-2013 in Barbados, by comparing documented treatment given in the
  single tertiary public hospital with international guideline recommendations. METHODS:
  Evidence-based stroke management guidelines were identified through a systematic
  literature search. Comparisons were made between these guidelines and documented
  diagnostic practice (all strokes) and prescribed medication (ischaemic stroke only),
  using a combination of key informant interviews and national stroke registry data
  for 2010-2013. RESULTS: Several published international guidelines for the acute
  management of ischaemic stroke recommended patient management in a dedicated stroke
  unit or nearest hospital specialised in stroke care. Further, patients should receive
  clinical diagnosis, CT brain scan, specialist evaluation by a multidisciplinary
  team and, if eligible, thrombolysis with alteplase within 3-3.5 h of symptom onset.
  Subsequent secondary prophylaxis, with a platelet aggregation inhibitor and a statin
  was advised. Barbados had no stroke unit or stroke team, and no official protocol
  for acute stroke management during the study period. Most of the 1735 stroke patients
  were managed by emergency physicians at presentation; if admitted, they were managed
  on general medical wards. Most had a CT scan (1646; 94.9%). Of 1406 registered ischaemic
  stroke patients, only 6 (0.4%) had been thrombolysed, 521 (37.1%) received aspirin
  within 24 h of admission and 670 (47.7%) were prescribed aspirin on discharge. CONCLUSIONS:
  Acute ischaemic stroke diagnosis was consistent with international recommendations,
  although this was less evident for treatment. While acknowledging the difficulty
  in implementing international guidelines in a low-resource setting, there is scope
  for improvement in acute ischaemic stroke management and/or its documentation in
  Barbados. A stroke unit was established in August 2013 and written clinical protocols
  for acute stroke care were in development at the time of the study; future registry
  data will evaluate their impact. Our findings have implications for other low-resource
  settings with high stroke burden.'
