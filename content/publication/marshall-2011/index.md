abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The causes of oedematous vs non-oedematous childhood malnutrition
  (OM vs NOM) remain elusive. It is possible that inherited differences in handling
  oxidant stressors are a contributing factor. AIMS: To test for associations between
  polymorphisms in five genes and (i) risk of OM, a case-control study, and (ii) percentage
  cytotoxicity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to hydrogen peroxide
  (H(2)O(2)), an in vitro cell challenge study. METHODS: Participants had been admitted
  previously for treatment of OM (cases, n = 74) or NOM (controls, n = 50), or were
  an independent set of healthy pregnant women (n = 47) who donated peripheral blood
  mononuclear cells. We tested for associations between genetic variation and outcome
  using single markers or a bivariate score constructed by counting numbers of deleterious
  alleles for each of 15 possible pairs of markers. RESULTS: In the case-control study
  there were no significant single-marker associations with OM. We did find that higher
  bivariate scores were associated with OM for the pair of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase
  1 and catalase (odds ratio 2·00, 95% CI 1·05-3·82). In the cell challenge experiments,
  there were no significant associations with percentage cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS:
  Variation in this small set of genes seems unlikely to have a large impact on either
  risk of OM or cytotoxicity after H(2)O(2) exposure. The use of larger sample sizes
  to test the effects of a much larger set of genetic variants will be required in
  order to determine whether genetic variation contributes to the risk of OM. Such
  studies have potential for improving our understanding of causal pathways in OM.'
