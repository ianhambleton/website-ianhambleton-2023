abstract: 'Chronic leg ulceration is a major cause of morbidity in homozygous sickle
  cell (SS) disease in Jamaica. These ulcers have features in common with venous ulcers
  in patients with a normal haemoglobin genotype (AA). Thus we sought to determine
  whether there is abnormal venous function in the legs of patients with SS disease
  who have ulcers. Experiments were performed on 15 SS patients with ulcers, and on
  15 SS patients and 15 AA subjects with no history of leg ulcers. Changes in venous
  blood volume of the bottom one-third of the leg induced by venous occlusion and
  release were studied by air plethysmography, providing indices of segmental venous
  capacitance (SVC), maximal venous outflow (MVO) and venous emptying time (VET).
  The changes in volume (ambulatory volume change; AVC) induced by a period of leg
  exercise were also measured at the ankle (AVCa) and calf (AVCc); venous refilling
  times at these sites (RTa and RTc respectively) were also measured. Finally, cutaneous
  red blood cell flux recovery time (FRT) after ankle exercise was assessed by laser
  Doppler flowmetry. Measurements were also made of haematological variables. SVC,
  MVO and VET did not differ between the groups, indicating no deep venous obstruction
  in the SS patients with ulcers. AVCc, AVCa and RTc did not differ among the three
  subject groups. However, compared with AA subjects, SS patients with ulcers had
  reduced RTa and FRT. Moreover, RTa and FRT were further shortened in SS patients
  with ulcers relative to SS patients without ulcers. Since the levels of anaemia
  were similar in SS patients with and without ulcers, these differences cannot be
  attributed to differences in arterial flow secondary to anaemia. These results suggest
  abnormal venous function in SS patients with ulcers, relative to both AA subjects
  and SS patients without ulcers. We propose that there is incompetence of venous
  valves draining the ankle region of SS patients with ulcers: the consequent raised
  venous pressure contributes to the slow healing and, possibly, to the onset of leg
  ulceration in SS disease.'
