abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Comparable global data on health and nutrition of school-aged
  children and adolescents are scarce. We aimed to estimate age trajectories and time
  trends in mean height and mean body-mass index (BMI), which measures weight gain
  beyond what is expected from height gain, for school-aged children and adolescents.
  METHODS: For this pooled analysis, we used a database of cardiometabolic risk factors
  collated by the Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factor Collaboration. We applied a
  Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1985 to 2019 in mean height
  and mean BMI in 1-year age groups for ages 5-19 years. The model allowed for non-linear
  changes over time in mean height and mean BMI and for non-linear changes with age
  of children and adolescents, including periods of rapid growth during adolescence.
  FINDINGS: We pooled data from 2181 population-based studies, with measurements of
  height and weight in 65 million participants in 200 countries and territories. In
  2019, we estimated a difference of 20 cm or higher in mean height of 19-year-old
  adolescents between countries with the tallest populations (the Netherlands, Montenegro,
  Estonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina for boys; and the Netherlands, Montenegro, Denmark,
  and Iceland for girls) and those with the shortest populations (Timor-Leste, Laos,
  Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea for boys; and Guatemala, Bangladesh, Nepal,
  and Timor-Leste for girls). In the same year, the difference between the highest
  mean BMI (in Pacific island countries, Kuwait, Bahrain, The Bahamas, Chile, the
  USA, and New Zealand for both boys and girls and in South Africa for girls) and
  lowest mean BMI (in India, Bangladesh, Timor-Leste, Ethiopia, and Chad for boys
  and girls; and in Japan and Romania for girls) was approximately 9-10 kg/m(2). In
  some countries, children aged 5 years started with healthier height or BMI than
  the global median and, in some cases, as healthy as the best performing countries,
  but they became progressively less healthy compared with their comparators as they
  grew older by not growing as tall (eg, boys in Austria and Barbados, and girls in
  Belgium and Puerto Rico) or gaining too much weight for their height (eg, girls
  and boys in Kuwait, Bahrain, Fiji, Jamaica, and Mexico; and girls in South Africa
  and New Zealand). In other countries, growing children overtook the height of their
  comparators (eg, Latvia, Czech Republic, Morocco, and Iran) or curbed their weight
  gain (eg, Italy, France, and Croatia) in late childhood and adolescence. When changes
  in both height and BMI were considered, girls in South Korea, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia,
  Turkey, and some central Asian countries (eg, Armenia and Azerbaijan), and boys
  in central and western Europe (eg, Portugal, Denmark, Poland, and Montenegro) had
  the healthiest changes in anthropometric status over the past 3Â·5 decades because,
  compared with children and adolescents in other countries, they had a much larger
  gain in height than they did in BMI. The unhealthiest changes-gaining too little
  height, too much weight for their height compared with children in other countries,
  or both-occurred in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, New Zealand, and the USA
  for boys and girls; in Malaysia and some Pacific island nations for boys; and in
  Mexico for girls. INTERPRETATION: The height and BMI trajectories over age and time
  of school-aged children and adolescents are highly variable across countries, which
  indicates heterogeneous nutritional quality and lifelong health advantages and risks.
