abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To compare pregnancy outcome in sickle cell-haemoglobin C (SC)\
  \ disease with that in homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease and age-matched controls\
  \ with a normal haemoglobin (AA) genotype. DESIGN: A cohort study followed from\
  \ birth. SETTING: Sickle Cell Clinic, University Hospital and other Jamaican hospitals.\
  \ POPULATION: Ninety-five pregnancies in 43 patients with SC disease, 94 pregnancies\
  \ in 52 patients with SS disease and 157 pregnancies in 68 controls. METHODS: Systematic\
  \ review of all pregnancies occurring in sample population. Kaplan-Meier analysis\
  \ for interval to first pregnancy, and the t test, chi2 test or Fisher's exact test\
  \ as appropriate; correction was made for multiple testing and multiple linear regression\
  \ was used for analysis of determinants of birthweight. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age\
  \ at menarche, interval to first pregnancy, outcome of pregnancy, maternal complications\
  \ and possible predictors of low birthweight. RESULTS: Menarche was marginally delayed\
  \ in SC disease compared with AA controls (median age 13.7 vs 13.0 years, P= 0.02)\
  \ but age at first pregnancy was similar (median age 22.5 vs 20.1 years, P= 0.32).\
  \ Pregnancy outcome in SC disease did not differ from AA controls but compared with\
  \ SS disease there were marginally fewer miscarriages, more live deliveries and\
  \ greater birthweight. The prevalence of pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia,\
  \ antepartum or postpartum haemorrhage in SC disease did not differ from AA controls\
  \ but the prevalence of sickle-related complications was similar to SS disease.\
  \ CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to some claims, pregnancy outcome in SC disease is generally\
  \ benign compared with SS disease."
