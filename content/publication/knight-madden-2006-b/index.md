abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Asthma causes significant morbidity and mortality in the developing
  world. It is thus important to identify modifiable risk factors. OBJECTIVES: To
  undertake a cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence of skin test reactivity
  to aeroallergens in Jamaican children and adults and the relationship of the diagnosis
  of asthma to the pattern of skin test positivity. METHODS: One hundred and sixty
  subjects without the sickle cell gene (genotype AA), eighty adults and eighty children,
  were recruited. Skin testing to seven aeroallergens was undertaken (atopy being
  diagnosed if there were at least one positive reaction). Asthma status was determined
  by a questionnaire and/or medical records. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (34%) of the children
  and forty-one (51%) of the adults were skin test positive to at least one aeroallergen.
  The most common positive responses in both age groups were to Dermatophagoides farinae,
  Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and cockroach mix-(German and American). All adult
  asthmatics with current symptoms reacted to cockroach allergen. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate
  steps to reduce cockroaches and cockroach sensitization might positively impact
  on asthma morbidity in Jamaica.'
