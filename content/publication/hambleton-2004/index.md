abstract: "OBJECTIVES: Life-threatening clinical complications can occur in the first\
  \ years of life in people with homozygous sickle cell disease. There is consensus\
  \ that a clinical care programme comanaged by a specialist clinic should follow\
  \ early-life disease identification. In a setting without widespread neonatal screening\
  \ for this disease, we predict the percentage of affected births that enrol in specialist\
  \ clinics during childhood, and the percentage that enrol early enough to benefit\
  \ from penicillin prophylaxis (which is offered until five years of age). SETTING:\
  \ A retrospective study of enrolment between 1973 and 1999 at three clinics in Jamaica,\
  \ the country's only referral centres for sickle cell disease. RESULTS: Among enrolees\
  \ not screened at birth, observed enrolment by age five was 10.1% (95% confidence\
  \ interval [CI] 5.7-16.7%) among 1974 births, which is predicted to rise to 35.7%\
  \ (95% CI 35.0-36.4%) among 1999 births. Observed enrolment by 18 years of age was\
  \ 45.9% (95% CI 35.7-58.2%) among 1974 births, which is predicted to peak at 61.9%\
  \ (95% CI 60.5-63.2%) among 1984 births, and fall to 48.9% (95% CI 40.9-56.9%) among\
  \ 1999 births. Median age at enrolment was 10.5 years (95% CI 10.0-11.3). CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ Based on 1999 estimates, almost 65% of children affected by homozygous sickle\
  \ cell disease not identified at birth will not benefit from important early-life\
  \ clinical intervention, and half will not enrol for specialised care by their 18th\
  \ birthday. Among patients that enrol, half do so in adolescence when management\
  \ is less focused on preventive care."
