abstract: Infection with human parvovirus B19 is known to cause aplastic crises in
  patients with homozygous sickle-cell disease. We studied the haematological consequences
  of parvovirus B19 infection in 280 such patients who had been followed up from birth
  in Jamaica. Evidence of seroconversion was routinely sought with a baculovirus-based,
  enzyme immunoassay in serum samples taken during aplastic crises and in all stored
  annual serum samples. 70% of patients had seroconverted by age 20 years; of 177
  infections, haematological change was typical of aplastic crises in 118 (67%), minor
  in 16 (9%), and not discernible in 43 (24%). This assay increased the detection
  of unsuspected seroconversion-an observation important in planning a strategy for
  parvovirus B19 immunisation.
