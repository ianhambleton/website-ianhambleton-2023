abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To determine whether children with homozygous sickle cell (SS)
  disease and splenectomy are at greater risk of death, overwhelming septicemia, or
  other complications. METHODS: A total of 130 patients with SS treated by splenectomy
  (46 recurrent acute splenic sequestration, 84 chronic hypersplenism) over a 22.5-year
  period at the Sickle Cell Clinic of the University Hospital of the West Indies,
  Kingston, Jamaica, were compared with a control group matched for sex, age, and
  duration of follow-up in a retrospective review. Deaths and bacteremias were examined
  over the whole study period. Painful crises, acute chest syndromes, and febrile
  episodes were compared in the 90 patients completing 5 years of postsplenectomy
  follow-up. FINDINGS: Mortality and bacteremic episodes did not differ between the
  splenectomy and control groups. Painful crises were more common in the splenectomy
  group than in the control group (P =.01) but did not differ between splenectomy
  indications. Acute chest syndrome was more common in the splenectomy group than
  in the control group (P <.01) and was more common in the acute splenic sequestration
  group than in the hypersplenism group (P =.01). Febrile events did not differ between
  the groups or between the indications for splenectomy. CONCLUSION: Splenectomy does
  not increase the risk of death or bacteremic illness in patients with SS disease
  and, if otherwise indicated, should not be deferred for these reasons.'
