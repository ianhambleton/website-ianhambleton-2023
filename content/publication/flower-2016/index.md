abstract: "BACKGROUND: Medication adherence in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)\
  \ reduces disease activity and the risk of flares. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated adherence\
  \ in women with SLE who exhibit high morbidity and mortality. We evaluated demographic\
  \ data and 2 conventional adherence predictors: self-efficacy and health literacy,\
  \ along with 2 potential neuropsychiatric SLE complications: cognitive dysfunction\
  \ and depression. METHODS: One hundred six women randomly selected from the Barbados\
  \ National Lupus Registry completed the Self-efficacy for Appropriate Medication\
  \ Use Scale, Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine-Short Form, Cognitive\
  \ Symptom Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory II, and Morisky's Medication Adherence\
  \ Questionnaire (MAQ). This study explored the effects of psychosocial and neuropsychiatric\
  \ functioning on adherence using ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: Sixty percent\
  \ reported high MAQ scores. The probability of high MAQ scores was lower among younger\
  \ patients (P = 0.001) and those with shorter disease duration (P = 0.05). The probability\
  \ of high MAQ scores fell with lower perceived self-efficacy (odds ratio [OR], 0.80;\
  \ 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.89; P < 0.001), worsening cognitive function\
  \ (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.97; P = 0.004), and increasing depression (OR, 0.93;\
  \ 95% CI, 0.88-0.97; P = 0.002). There was no strong relationship between MAQ score\
  \ and health literacy (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.13-1.03; P = 0.06). CONCLUSION: Women\
  \ with SLE who are younger and those with shorter disease duration should be assessed\
  \ for medication adherence. Screening at diagnosis followed by routine assessment\
  \ of cognitive dysfunction and depression along with perceived self-efficacy may\
  \ further identify the most vulnerable subgroup who should be targeted with personalized\
  \ intervention strategies."
