 abstract = {The prevalence, incidence, risk factors, clinical associations, and morbidity of gallstones were studied in 311 patients with homozygous sickle cell disease and 167 patients with sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease in a cohort study from birth. Gallstones developed in 96 patients with homozygous sickle cell disease and 18 patients with sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease; specific symptoms necessitating cholecystectomy occurred in only 7 patients with homozygous sickle cell disease.},
