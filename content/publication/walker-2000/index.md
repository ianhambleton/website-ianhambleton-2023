abstract: The prevalence, incidence, risk factors, clinical associations, and morbidity
  of gallstones were studied in 311 patients with homozygous sickle cell disease and
  167 patients with sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease in a cohort study from birth.
  Gallstones developed in 96 patients with homozygous sickle cell disease and 18 patients
  with sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease; specific symptoms necessitating cholecystectomy
  occurred in only 7 patients with homozygous sickle cell disease.
