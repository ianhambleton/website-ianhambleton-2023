abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: A low mean birth weight is a constant finding in pregnancies
  of women with homozygous sickle cell disease. The factors responsible are largely
  unknown and have now been investigated in an 11-year retrospective analysis. METHODS:
  Records for 126 pregnancies of mothers with homozygous sickle cell disease and 126
  pregnancies of control women with an AA phenotype, matched according to age and
  date of delivery, were examined. Events during pregnancy and outcomes of pregnancy
  were recorded. RESULTS: Pregnancy outcomes for mothers with homozygous sickle cell
  disease confirmed the lower birth weight, gestational age, and placental weight.
  A low birth weight in infants of mothers with homozygous sickle cell disease was
  strongly related to gestational age and placental weight and weakly related to reticulocyte
  counts and a history of preeclampsia in univariate analyses, but only gestational
  age and placental weight remained significant in multivariate analyses. No relationships
  were seen with maternal age, parity, anthropometric features, other hematologic
  features (hemoglobin levels, fetal hemoglobin levels, mean cell volume, and alpha-thalassemia),
  pregnancy-induced hypertension, or prepartum hospital admissions (expressed as number
  or total days). Compared with Jamaican standards, birth weight was affected more
  than head circumference or length in infants of mothers with homozygous sickle cell
  disease, indicating asymmetric growth retardation, which occurred for 27% of boys
  and 38% of girls (compared with 4% and 9%, respectively, among infants of control
  mothers). CONCLUSIONS: A chronic condition such as homozygous sickle cell disease
  might have been expected to cause symmetric growth retardation throughout pregnancy.
  The finding of asymmetric retardation might indicate adverse factors emerging late
  in pregnancy and might have relevance for the poor pregnancy outcomes in such mothers.'
