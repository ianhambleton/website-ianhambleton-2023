abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence, pattern, and outcome of priapism
  in homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease. METHODS: Regular review, for periods up
  to 40 years, was done of all 162 males with SS disease detected during the screening
  of 100 000 consecutive non-operative deliveries at the main government maternity
  hospital in Kingston, Jamaica, between June 1973 and December 1981. RESULTS: Priapism
  occurred in 52 (32.7%) patients overall, the incidence rising steeply in late adolescence
  to 32% by age 20 years and a cumulative incidence of nearly 60% of patients by age
  40 years. Many cases were elicited only on direct questioning because of embarrassment
  and the lack of realization that priapism complicates SS disease. Initial events
  were recurrent stuttering episodes in 39 patients, a single short-term event in
  six patients and a major attack (more than six hours) in seven patients. Erectile
  function was preserved in almost all patients with simple stuttering or single events.
  Major attacks (> 6 hours) occurred in 17 patients, preceded by stuttering episodes
  in nine, by a single event in one, and occurring de novo in seven. In these, erectile
  function was unknown in five, deemed satisfactory in five (sometimes improving over
  three years), weak in three and impotence persisted in four (two with major attacks
  three and six months previously). CONCLUSION: A history of stuttering priapism should
  be routinely enquired and prophylactic measures used if attacks exceed once weekly.
  Major events generally result in short-term impotence, but the late recovery of
  erectile function cautions against the early insertion of penile prostheses.'
