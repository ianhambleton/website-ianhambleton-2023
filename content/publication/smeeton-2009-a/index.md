abstract: 'BACKGROUND: To compare health care utilisation between stroke patients
  living in a middle-income country with similar patients in a high-income country
  in terms of the type and amount of health care received following a stroke. METHODS:
  Data were collected from the population-based South London Stroke Register (SLSR)
  and the Barbados Register of Strokes (BROS) from January 2001 to December 2004.
  Differences in management and diagnostic procedures used in the acute phase were
  adjusted for age, sex, ethnic group, living conditions pre-stroke and socio-economic
  status by multivariable logistic regression. Comparison of subsequent management
  was made for 3 months and 1 year post-stroke. RESULTS: Patients in BROS were less
  likely to be admitted to a hospital ward (OR 0.22; 95% CI 0.13-0.37), but the difference
  for the lower use of brain scans in BROS was smaller (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.25-1.52).
  Additional adjustment for stroke severity (Glasgow Coma Score) showed that BROS
  patients were more likely to have a swallow test on admission (OR 2.95; 95% CI 1.17-7.45).
  BROS patients were less likely to be in nursing care at 3 months (OR 0.37; 95% CI
  0.17-0.81), and less likely to be receiving speech and language therapy at 3 months
  (OR 0.10; 95% CI 0.03-0.33) and 1 year (OR 0.05; 95% CI 0.00-0.55). CONCLUSIONS:
  The lower use of hospital admission and nursing care at 3 months suggests that in
  Barbados, family and friends take greater responsibility for patient care around
  the time of the stroke and in the medium term thereafter.'
