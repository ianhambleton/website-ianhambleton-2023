abstract: 'PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to provide baseline HPV genotype distribution
  among women in Barbados before HPV immunization was introduced. This information
  would then be used as a denominator for post-vaccine surveillance and is expected
  to aid in understanding the effect of vaccination on cervical disease in Barbados.
  METHODS: Liquid-based cytology specimens were collected from 413 women (age range
  18-65 years) attending three clinics, in a pre-vaccination, population-based study.
  After consent was obtained, sexual behavior and socio-demographic information were
  acquired from self-administered questionnaires. HPV types were detected using Luminex-based
  HPV PCR genotyping methodology. RESULTS: HPV was detected in 33% (135/413) of the
  subjects overall (95% CI 32.7, 33.37), of which 70% (95/135) were high-risk types,
  with 35 different types being detected in this population. Single and multiple high-risk
  HPV types were detected in 14% (13/95) and 31% (29/95) of the subjects, respectively.
  The most common high-risk HPV types detected were 45(n = 22, 23%), 16 (n = 17, 18%),
  52 (n = 16, 17%), and 58 (n = 10, 11%). Persons with the highest level of infection
  by age were 21-25 (n = 25/135;19%; 95% CI 18.8, 19.3); 26-30 (n = 22/135;16%; 95%
  CI 15.9, 16.2); 31-35 (n = 19/135;14%; 95% CI 13.9, 14.2); 36-40 (n = 17/135;13%;
  95% CI 12.2, 13.2), and 18-21 (n = 15/135;11%; 95% CI 10.9, 11.2). 91/413 (22%)
  persons had a normal cytology result. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of HPV type
  45 was found in the screening population of women in Barbados. The results of cytological
  examinations and HPV positivity suggest that both tests should be used for greater
  reliable diagnosis of HPV infection.'
