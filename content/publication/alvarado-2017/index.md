abstract: A 10% excise tax on sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) was implemented in
  Barbados in September 2015. A national evaluation has been established to assess
  the impact of the tax. We present a descriptive analysis of initial price changes
  following implementation of the SSB tax using price data provided by a major supermarket
  chain in Barbados over the period 2014-2016. We summarize trends in price changes
  for SSBs and non-SSBs before and after the tax using year-on-year mean price per
  liter. We find that prior to the tax, the year-on-year growth of SSB and non-SSB
  prices was very similar (approximately 1%). During the quarter in which the tax
  was implemented, the trends diverged, with SSB price growth increasing to 3% and
  that of non-SSBs decreasing slightly. The growth of SSB prices outpaced non-SSBs
  prices in each quarter thereafter, reaching 5.9% compared to <1% for non-SSBs. Future
  analyses will assess the trends in prices of SSBs and non-SSBs over a longer period
  and will integrate price data from additional sources to assess heterogeneity of
  post-tax price changes. A continued examination of the impact of the SSB tax in
  Barbados will expand the evidence base available to policymakers worldwide in considering
  SSB taxes as a lever for reducing the consumption of added sugar at the population
  level.
