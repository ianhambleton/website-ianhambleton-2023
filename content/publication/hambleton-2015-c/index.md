abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: We investigated changes in life expectancy (LE) and cause-specific
  mortality over time, directly comparing African-descent populations in the United
  States and the Caribbean. METHODS: We compared LE at birth and cause-specific mortality
  in 6 disease groups between Caribbean countries with a majority (>â€‰90%) African-descent
  population and US African Americans. RESULTS: The LE improvement among African Americans
  exceeded that of Afro-Caribbeans so that the LE gap, which favored the Caribbean
  population by 1.5 years in 1990, had been reversed by 2009. This relative improvement
  among African Americans was mainly the result of the improving mortality experience
  of African American men. Between 2000 and 2009, Caribbean mortality rates in 5 of
  the 6 disease groups increased relative to those of African Americans. By 2009,
  mortality from cerebrovascular diseases, cancers, and diabetes was higher in Afro-Caribbeans
  relative to African Americans, with a diabetes mortality rate twice that of African
  Americans and 4 times that of White Americans. CONCLUSIONS: The Caribbean community
  made important mortality reductions between 2000 and 2009, but this progress fell
  short of African American health improvements in the same period, especially among
  men.'
