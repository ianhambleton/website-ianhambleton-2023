abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews of treatment interventions in stable or
  chronic conditions often require the synthesis of clinical trials with a cross-over
  design. Previous work has indicated that methodology for analysing cross-over data
  is inadequate in trial reports and in systematic reviews assessing trials with this
  design. OBJECTIVE: We assessed systematic review methodology for synthesising cross-over
  trials among Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group reviews published
  to July 2015, and assessed the quality of reporting among the cross-over trials
  included in these reviews. METHODOLOGY: We performed data extraction of methodology
  and reporting in reviews, trials identified and trials included within reviews.
  PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We reviewed a total of 142 Cochrane systematic reviews including
  53 reviews which synthesised evidence from 218 cross-over trials. Thirty-three (63%)
  Cochrane reviews described a clear and appropriate method for the inclusion of cross-over
  data, and of these 19 (56%) used the same method to analyse results. 145 cross-over
  trials were described narratively or treated as parallel trials in reviews but in
  30 (21%) of these trials data existed in the trial reports to account for the cross-over
  design. At the trial level, the analysis and presentation of results were often
  inappropriate or unclear, with only 69 (32%) trials presenting results that could
  be included in meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite development of accessible, technical
  guidance and training for Cochrane systematic reviewers, statistical analysis and
  reporting of cross-over data is inadequate at both the systematic review and the
  trial level. Plain language and practical guidance for the inclusion of cross-over
  data in meta-analysis would benefit systematic reviewers, who come from a wide range
  of health specialties. Minimum reporting standards for cross-over trials are needed.'
