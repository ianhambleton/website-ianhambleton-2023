abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To determine baseline characteristics of an occupational cohort
  of women in Mwanza City, Tanzania, and factors associated with reattendance at 3
  months, in preparation for a microbicide trial. STUDY DESIGN: One thousand five
  hundred seventy-three women aged 16-54 years working in food outlets and recreational
  facilities were enrolled, interviewed, and examined at community-based reproductive
  health clinics, provided specimens for HIV/STI and pregnancy testing, and attended
  3 monthly clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Baseline prevalence of HIV was 25.5%; pregnancy
  9.7%; herpes simplex virus type-2 74.6%; active syphilis 10.2%, bacterial vaginosis
  52.6%; gonorrhea 5.5%; chlamydia 5.9%; and trichomoniasis 12.3%. Reattendance at
  3 months was 74.1% and was higher in older women, less mobile women, and in those
  who received an HIV-negative result at enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline characteristics
  of this occupational group suggest their suitability for microbicide trials. A screening
  round, locally appropriate informed consent procedures, and effective community
  tracing may help reduce losses to follow-up in such settings.'
