abstract: 'Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have high and increasing rates of
  diet-related diseases. This situation is associated with a loss of food sovereignty
  and an increasing reliance on nutritionally poor food imports. A policy goal, therefore,
  is to improve local diets through improved local production of nutritious foods.
  Our aim in this study was to develop methods and collect preliminary data on the
  relationships between where people source their food, their socio-demographic characteristics
  and dietary quality in Fiji and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) in order
  to inform further work towards this policy goal. We developed a toolkit of methods
  to collect individual-level data, including measures of dietary intake, food sources,
  socio-demographic and health indicators. Individuals aged ≥15 years were eligible
  to participate. From purposively sampled urban and rural areas, we recruited 186
  individuals from 95 households in Fiji, and 147 individuals from 86 households in
  SVG. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression were used to investigate
  associations. The mean dietary diversity score, out of 10, was 3.7 (SD1.4) in Fiji
  and 3.8 (SD1.5) in SVG. In both settings, purchasing was the most common way of
  sourcing food. However, 68% (Fiji) and 45% (SVG) of participants regularly (>weekly)
  consumed their own produce, and 5% (Fiji) and 33% (SVG) regularly consumed borrowed/exchanged/bartered
  food. In regression models, independent positive associations with dietary diversity
  (DD) were: borrowing/exchanging/bartering food (β = 0.73 (0.21, 1.25)); age (0.01
  (0.00, 0.03)); and greater than primary education (0.44 (0.06, 0.82)). DD was negatively
  associated with small shop purchasing (-0.52 (95% CIs -0.91, -0.12)) and rural residence
  (-0.46 (-0.92, 0.00)). The findings highlight associations between dietary diversity
  and food sources and indicate avenues for further research to inform policy actions
  aimed at improving local food production and diet.'
