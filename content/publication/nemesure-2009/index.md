abstract: The Barbados National Cancer Study (BNCS) is a nationwide case-control study
  investigating environmental and genetic factors for breast cancer (BC) in a predominantly
  African-origin population with similar ancestry as African-Americans. This report
  evaluates associations of incident BC in the BNCS to various factors, including
  demographic, anthropometric, reproductive and family history variables, not investigated
  previously in this population. The BNCS included 241 incident BC cases and 481 age-matched
  female controls, with mean ages of 57 and 56 years, respectively. In addition to
  a reported family history of BC in a close relative [odds ratios (OR) = 3.74, 95%
  CI (1.41, 9.90) in a parent; OR = 3.26 (1.47, 7.21) in a sibling], other factors
  associated with BC were older age at first full-term pregnancy [OR = 1.04 (1.00,
  1.07)] and having a history of benign breast disease [OR = 1.88 (1.19, 2.99)]. Increased
  parity reduced the risk of BC [OR = 0.34 (0.15, 0.77) among those with >or=3 children].
  The reproductive patterns of African-Barbadian (AB) women tended to differ from
  those of African-American (AA) women (later age of menarche, earlier age at first
  pregnancy, higher frequency of lactation and infrequent use of exogenous hormones)
  and could help to explain their considerably lower postmenopausal incidence of BC.
  The relationship between reported family history and BC, combined with the associations
  noted for several reproductive and other variables, supports the genetic and environmental
  contributions to BC, which may vary in populations across the African diaspora.
  Further investigations of other populations may clarify these issues.
