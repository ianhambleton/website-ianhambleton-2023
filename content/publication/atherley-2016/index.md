abstract: "BACKGROUND: Transitions in medical education are emotionally and socially\
  \ dynamic; this may affect learning. Students transitioning from preclinical to\
  \ clinical training may experience negative consequences. Less is understood about\
  \ students' experiences during transitions within clinical training and influential\
  \ factors. METHODS: The authors used organizational socialization theory to explore\
  \ a transition within the clinical years. Final-year medical students experienced\
  \ a nine-week internal medicine clerkship; willing students participated. Students\
  \ (n = 101; 97 %) completed a questionnaire with open-ended questions at the beginning\
  \ and end of the clerkship and participated in six consecutive focus groups, until\
  \ data saturation occurred (n = 37). Data were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Socialization\
  \ was challenging. Many students experienced difficulty developing relationships\
  \ with team members. Students with a positive attitude experienced a smoother transition.\
  \ Many students were uncertain of their roles, concerned about the workload and\
  \ desired guidance to meet clerkship demands. This transition resulted in varied\
  \ outcomes from enjoyment, increased confidence and student development through\
  \ to disinterest. CONCLUSION: Transitions within clinical training are complex.\
  \ Faculty should focus on adequate socialization in a new clerkship as this may\
  \ facilitate a smoother transition. This may necessitate orientations, staff training,\
  \ and formal student support. Further research is needed on the impact of these\
  \ recommendations on learning and well-being."
