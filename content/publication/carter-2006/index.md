abstract: "This article's objective is to examine the epidemiology of obesity in the\
  \ urban elderly population of Barbados. A random sample of adults >/= 60 years underwent\
  \ comprehensive interviews and measurement of their weight, height, and waist circumference\
  \ (WC). Outcomes of interest were obesity (body mass index [BMI] > 30 kg/m2), high-risk\
  \ WC (men >/= 102 cm; women >/= 88 cm), and high risk of disease comorbidity (from\
  \ BMI and WC criteria). Total, 1,508 persons participated (80% response). Women\
  \ had higher rates of obesity (31% vs. 11.9%), high-risk WC (61.9% vs. 13.9%), and\
  \ disease co-morbidity risk (51.1% vs. 17.5%) compared to men. Multivariate regression\
  \ confirmed female gender as an independent predictor of outcomes (p < 0.001). Other\
  \ predictors were less consistent: self-reported fair/poor health status and eating\
  \ two (vs. three) meals daily were associated with obesity, whereas semiprofessional\
  \ occupation and unmarried status predicted high-risk WC. Obesity is highly prevalent\
  \ among elderly Barbadians. Public health interventions must target this group,\
  \ particularly women."
