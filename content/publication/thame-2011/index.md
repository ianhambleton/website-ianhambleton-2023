abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To assess pregnancy weight gain and newborn anthropometry in\
  \ mothers with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease and normal controls. METHODS:\
  \ An eleven-year retrospective review at the University Hospital of the West Indies,\
  \ Kingston, Jamaica, revealed 128 singleton deliveries in women with SS disease\
  \ who were matched by maternal age and birth date with 128 controls with a normal\
  \ AA phenotype. Restriction to those commencing antenatal care before 16 weeks gestation\
  \ resulted in the final study group of 80 SS patients and 115 AA controls. Weight\
  \ and height were measured at first antenatal visit and weight at 20, 25, 30, 35\
  \ and 38 weeks gestation. Longitudinal regression used mothers'weight as the outcome,\
  \ genotype as a predictor and gestational age as a random effect. Regression analyses\
  \ of maternal weight on childhood anthropometry were repeated in separate maternal\
  \ genotypes. Neonatal indices included gestational age, birthweight, head circumference\
  \ and crown-heel length. RESULTS: Mothers with SS disease had lower weight and body\
  \ mass index at first antenatal clinic visit (p < 0.001). Total weight gain was\
  \ 6.9 kg for SS women and 10.4 kg for AA controls (p < 0.001) and weekly weight\
  \ gain 0.263 kg (95% CI 0.224, 0.301) and 0.396 kg (95% CI 0.364, 0.427) respectively.\
  \ A significant relationship occurred between birthweight and maternal weight gain\
  \ at 25-30 weeks gestation in AA controls but this relationship appears delayed\
  \ in SS disease. CONCLUSION: Different patterns of maternal weight gain in SS mothers\
  \ and normal controls may have significance for the lower birthweight in SS mothers."
