abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To determine prevalence of, and risk factors for, bacterial
  vaginosis (BV) among herpes simplex virus (HSV) 2 seropositive Tanzanian women at
  enrollment into a randomised, placebo-controlled trial of HSV suppressive treatment.
  METHODS: 1305 HSV-2 seropositive women aged 16-35 years working in bars, guesthouses
  and similar facilities were interviewed, examined and tested for HIV, syphilis,
  Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, BV, candidiasis and trichomoniasis.
  Factors associated with BV were analysed using logistic regression to estimate odds
  ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: BV prevalence was 62.9%; prevalence
  of Nugent score 9-10 was 16.1%. Independent risk factors for BV were work facility
  type, fewer dependents, increasing alcohol consumption, sex in the last week (adjusted
  OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.57 to 2.62), using cloths or cotton wool for menstrual hygiene,
  HIV (adjusted OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.83) and Trichomonas vaginalis infection.
  There was no association between BV and the frequency or method of vaginal cleansing.
  However, BV was less prevalent among women who reported inserting substances to
  dry the vagina for sex (adjusted OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.75). CONCLUSION: BV was
  extremely prevalent among our study population of HSV-2 positive female facility
  workers in North-western Tanzania. Although recent sex was associated with increased
  BV prevalence, vaginal drying was associated with lower BV prevalence. Further studies
  of the effects of specific practices on vaginal flora are warranted.'
