abstract: In the U.K. and the U.S.A., painful crises account for 80-90% of sickle-related
  hospital admissions, with average durations of 5-11 d. In Jamaica, many severe painful
  crises are managed in a day-care centre. Patients (n=1160) with homozygous sickle
  cell (SS) disease aged 18 years and over were registered with the clinic during
  a 1-year study period. Of these, 216 patients with 476 painful crises attended the
  day-care facility for a total of 686 d. Most patients (119 or 55.1%) had single
  crises and for most crises (338 or 71%), patients attended for only 1 d, when they
  were given bed rest, assurance, rehydration and analgesia. Patients with complicated
  painful crises were usually referred for admission after initial pain relief and
  the rest were monitored during the day. In the evening they were given the option
  of hospital admission or allowed home with oral analgesia. Hospital admission for
  complicated painful crises or inadequate pain relief occurred in 42 (8.8%) crises
  and home management in 434 (91.2%) crises. Of 186 patients initially selecting home
  management, 20% returned for further day-care and five (2.7%) died during subsequent
  admission for that painful crisis, one without other known complications, two with
  acute chest syndrome (one associated with Salmonella septicaemia), another with
  Salmonella septicaemia, and one with dengue haemorrhagic fever. With suitable oral
  analgesia, adequate education and support, the majority of severe painful crises
  in SS disease in Jamaica have been managed on an outpatient basis. This model of
  patient care may merit assessment in other communities where painful crises are
  a common clinical problem.
