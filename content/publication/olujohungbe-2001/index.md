abstract: The transfusion history and frequency of red cell antibodies in patients
  with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease have been compared in 190 subjects from
  the Jamaican cohort study and 37 patients attending a sickle cell clinic in Manchester,
  England. The proportion of patients transfused did not differ between the groups
  although the number of units transfused and the frequency of red cell antibodies
  were significantly greater in the Manchester group. Immune antibodies occurred in
  three Jamaicans (2.6% of those transfused) and 16 UK subjects (76% of those transfused).
  Multiple antibodies occurred in 10 (63%) UK subjects but in no Jamaicans. Indications
  for transfusion also differed between the groups, Jamaican patients typically receiving
  1-2 units for acute anaemia or acute chest syndrome, whereas UK patients frequently
  had multiple transfusions in preoperative exchange or prophylaxis programmes. The
  greater red cell alloimmunization among UK patients probably reflects both the greater
  use of transfusion and the disparity between donor and recipient populations in
  the UK.
