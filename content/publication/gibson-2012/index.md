abstract: The aim of this study was to examine the accuracy and characteristics of
  detecting the beta-thalassaemia trait in populations of West African ancestry. School
  children, aged 16-19 years, in Manchester Parish, Jamaica were screened to detect
  the genes which could give rise to offspring with sickle cell disease. Haematological
  indices and HbA(2) levels in subjects with an MCH ≤ 26 pg and an RDW < 18.0 with
  DNA analysis in those with indices consistent with the beta thalassaemia trait were
  measured. The performance of published discriminant indices in distinguishing iron
  deficiency and beta-thalassaemia trait in this population was assessed. Of 10,148
  subjects, 1,739 (17.1%) had an AA haemoglobin phenotype and red cell indices consistent
  with beta-thalassaemia (MCH values ≤ 26 pg, RDW < 18.0) requiring estimations of
  HbA(2) levels. HbA(2) levels were ≥3.5% in 112 and beta-thalassaemia mutations were
  identified in 77 of these including the -88 C>T mutation in 35 (45%), -29 A>G in
  19 (25%), -90 C>T in 7 (9%), the IVS II-849 A>G in 5 (6%) with smaller contributions
  from five other mutations. Discriminant indices performed poorly in the differentiation
  of iron deficiency and the beta-thalassaemia trait. Detection of the beta-thalassaemia
  trait is relatively insensitive in populations of West African ancestry partly because
  of the mild defects characterising beta-thalassaemia in this population and also
  the high prevalence of deletional alpha thalassaemia. More sensitive indicators
  are required for beta-thalassaemia detection to inform such populations at risk
  of offspring with sickle cell disease.
