abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cause and outcome of high fever in Jamaican
  children with homozygous sickle cell disease. DESIGN: Retrospective review of febrile
  episodes in a three year period (1 September 1993 to 31 August 1996). SETTING: Sickle
  cell clinic, an outpatient clinic in Kingston run by the Medical Research Council
  Laboratories (Jamaica). PATIENTS: Patients with homozygous sickle cell disease under
  17 years of age presenting with an axillary temperature >/= 39.0 degrees C (102.4
  degrees F). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis, death. RESULTS: There were 165 events
  in 144 patients (66 (45.8%) boys) with a median age of 6.1 years. Bacteraemia was
  found in 10 (6.1%) events (three Streptococcus pneumoniae, two Haemophilus influenzae
  type b, two Salmonella sp, one Escherichia coli, one Enterobacter sp, and one Acinetobacter
  sp), and urinary tract infections in four (2.4%). All cultures of cerebrospinal
  fluid were sterile. Acute chest syndrome occurred in 36 (21.8%) events. A painful
  crisis was associated with 45 (27.3%) events and was the only pathology identified
  in 20 events (12.1%). Hospital admission was necessary in 66 cases including all
  those with bacteraemia and 31 with acute chest syndrome. There were two deaths:
  a 5 year old boy with septic shock associated with H influenzae septicaemia, and
  a 3 year old boy with the acute chest syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Painful crisis and
  acute chest syndrome were the most common complications associated with high fever,
  but other important associated features included bacteraemia and urinary tract infection.
  Enteric Gram negative organisms accounted for 50% of positive blood cultures.'
