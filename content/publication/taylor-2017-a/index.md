abstract: 'AIM: The purpose of this study was to document in people with type 2 diabetes
  (T2DM) in Barbados, attitudes and beliefs that may result in psychological insulin
  resistance. METHODS: A representative, population-based, sample of 175 eligible
  people with T2DM 25 years of age and over was surveyed by telephone. The 20-item
  insulin treatment appraisal scale (ITAS) was administered (score range 20 to 100
  for positive to negative perceptions). RESULTS: 117 people participated (67% response
  rate, 32% male, mean age 66 years, 90% Black, 22% on insulin). Of non-responders,
  52 were not contactable and 6 were difficult to communicate with. Negative perceptions
  about insulin use included - meant a worsening of diabetes (68%), would worry family
  (63%), feared self-injection (58%), meant a failure in self-management (57%), injections
  were painful (54%), would be seen as being sicker (46%), increased hypoglycaemia
  risk (38%), required effort (34%), causes weight gain (27%), causes a deterioration
  in health (14%), and would have to give up enjoyable activities (10%). Positive
  perceptions were - helps good glycaemic control (78%), would prevent complications
  (61%) and improves health (58%). Mean total ITAS score (61.6, SD = 7.7) was lower
  for those on insulin compared to those not on insulin (53.7 vs. 63.8, p < 0.0001).
  Sex, age and diabetes diagnosis duration were not significant predictors of ITAS
  score. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors related to patient beliefs and attitudes need
  to be considered and addressed when initiating insulin in order to minimise psychological
  insulin resistance and delay. Patients using insulin had less negative perceptions
  than those not on insulin.'
