abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: This study sought to compare vascular reactivity and carotid
  intima media thickness (CIMT) between Afro-Caribbean people in the United Kingdom
  (UK) and the West Indies and Afro-Caribbean and Caucasian people in the UK. BACKGROUND:
  Attenuated vascular reactivity and increased CIMT in black patients is seen as evidence
  for predisposition to vascular disease, but no comparisons exist between Afro-Caribbean
  people in different settings, which can provide insight into non-inherited determinants
  of increased ethnic susceptibility. METHODS: A representative community sample of
  81 healthy Afro-Caribbean people and 101 Caucasian people in the UK was compared
  with 197 matched Afro-Caribbean people in Jamaica. Small vessel reactivity was assessed
  by measuring the absolute change from baseline in the reflection index (RI) of the
  digital volume pulse during intravenous infusion of albuterol (5 microg/min, DeltaRI(ALB))
  and glyceryl trinitrate (5 microg/min, DeltaRI(GTN)). The CIMT was measured ultrasonographically
  in the distal 1 cm of the common carotid artery. RESULTS: Mean DeltaRI(ALB) was
  4.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3 to 6.1, p < 0.001) lower
  in UK Afro-Caribbean people compared with Jamaican Afro-Caribbean people and 2.6
  percentage points (95% CI, 0.4 to 4.7, p = 0.02) lower compared with Caucasian people,
  after adjusting for vascular risk profile. Adjusted mean CIMT of UK Afro-Caribbean
  people was 0.13 mm (95% CI, 0.08 to 0.17, p < 0.001) greater compared with Jamaican
  Afro-Caribbean people and 0.05 mm (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.10, p = 0.02) greater compared
  with Caucasian people. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy UK Afro-Caribbean people have greater
  and Jamaican Afro-Caribbean people have less impairment of vascular reactivity and
  intima media thickness compared with UK Caucasian people, suggesting that potentially
  modifiable environmental interactions may contribute to excess vascular disease
  in Afro-Caribbean people.'
